    "abstract": "Inspired by an industry initiative to address the celebrated market for lemons (poor-quality used cars), we investigate how incentives for a permissioned blockchain-based system in the automobile ecosystem can be designed to ensure high-quality data storage and use by different stakeholders. The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms. Furthermore, we explore incentive design in permissioned blockchains and discuss its latest implications.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum is a blockchain platform that hosts and executes smart contracts. Executing a function of a smart contract burns a certain amount of gas units (a.k.a., gas usage). The total gas usage depends on how much computing power is necessary to carry out the execution of the function. Ethereum follows a free-market policy for deciding the transaction fee for executing a transaction. More specifically, transaction issuers choose how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas (a.k.a., gas price). The final transaction fee corresponds to the gas price times the gas usage. Miners process transactions to gain mining rewards, which come directly from these transaction fees. The flexibility and the inherent complexity of the gas system pose challenges to the development of blockchain-powered applications. Developers of blockchain-powered applications need to translate requests received in the frontend of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Yet, it is unclear how developers should set the gas parameters of these transactions given that (i) miners are free to prioritize transactions whichever way they wish and (ii) the gas usage of a contract transaction is only known after the transaction is processed and included in a new block. In this article, we analyze the gas usage of Ethereum transactions that were processed between Oct. 2017 and Feb. 2019 (the Byzantium era). We discover that (i) most miners prioritize transactions based on their gas price only, (ii) 25% of the functions that received at least 10 transactions have an unstable gas usage (coefficient of variation = 19%), and (iii) a simple prediction model that operates on the recent gas usage of a function achieves an R-Squared of 0.76 and a median absolute percentage error of 3.3%. We conclude that (i) blockchain-powered application developers should be aware that transaction prioritization in Ethereum is frequently done based solely on the gas price of transactions (e.g., a higher transaction fee does not necessarily imply a higher transaction priority) and act accordingly and (ii) blockchain-powered application developers can leverage gas usage prediction models similar to ours to make more informed decisions to set the gas price of their transactions. Lastly, based on our findings, we list and discuss promising avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "Despite the large number of resources that blockchain has, and continues to mobilize, what makes the technology unique and why people engage with it is not yet fully understood. Hence, “Why blockchain?” is a question that many scientists and managers still ask themselves or must to answer when facing the technology's critics. While the question is undoubtedly justified, it cannot always be answered from a purely technical perspective. Thus, in this study, we apply a socio-technical information systems artifact perspective and analyze the reasons managers involved in the blockchain consortia have for using blockchain technology. Based on a multiple-case study of 19 blockchain consortia, including interviews with 53 stakeholders, we explicate 19 different motives that justify engagement with the technology in practice. Further, we identify the systemic character of tokenization and the importance of the socio-technical interplay of aspects like power decentralization that justify the necessity of blockchain.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals’ quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Numerous supply-chain combines with internet of things (IoT) applications have been proposed, and many methods and algorithms enhance the convenience of supply chains. However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.",

    "abstract": "The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.",

Generally, concurrent Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus method, named C-PBFT, is powerful to deal with the consensus inefficiencies, caused by the fast node expansion in the supply chain. However, due to the tremendous complicated transactions in the supply chain, it remains challenging to select the credible primary peers in the concurrent clusters. To address this challenge, the peers in the supply chain are classified into several clusters by analyzing the historic transactions in the ledger.

    "abstract": "Decentralized control, low-complexity, flexible and efficient communications are the requirements of an architecture that aims to scale blockchains beyond the current state. Such properties are attainable by reducing ledger size and providing parallel operations in the blockchain. Sharding is one of the approaches that lower the burden of the nodes and enhance performance. However, the current solutions lack the features for resolving concurrency during cross-shard communications. With multiple participants belonging to different shards, handling concurrent operations is essential for optimal sharding. This issue becomes prominent due to the lack of architectural support and requires additional consensus for cross-shard communications. Relying on the advantages of hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS), like Ethereum, hybrid consensus and 2-hop blockchain, we propose Reinshard, a new blockchain that inherits the properties of hybrid consensus for optimal sharding. Reinshard uses PoW and PoS chain-pairs with PoS sub-chains for all the valid chain-pairs where the hybrid consensus is attained through Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Our architecture provides a secure method of arranging nodes in shards and resolves concurrency conflicts using the delay factor of VDF. The applicability of Reinshard is demonstrated through security and experimental evaluations. A practical concurrency problem is considered to show the efficacy of Reinshard in providing optimal sharding.",

    "abstract": "The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we present ChaosETH, a chaos engineering approach for resilience assessment of Ethereum blockchain clients. ChaosETH operates in the following manner: First, it monitors Ethereum clients to determine their normal behavior. Then, it injects system call invocation errors into one single Ethereum client at a time and observes the behavior resulting from perturbation. Finally, ChaosETH compares the behavior recorded before, during, and after perturbation to assess the impact of the injected system call invocation errors. The experiments are performed on the two most popular Ethereum client implementations: GoEthereum and Nethermind. We assess the impact of 22 different system call errors on those Ethereum clients with respect to 15 application-level metrics. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of resilience characteristics of Ethereum clients w.r.t. system call invocation errors, ranging from direct crashes to full resilience. The experiments clearly demonstrate the feasibility of applying chaos engineering principles to blockchain systems.",

    "abstract": "Medical image fusion generates a fused image containing multiple features extracted from different source images, and it is of great help in clinical analysis and diagnosis. However, training a deep learning model for image fusion usually requires enormous computing power, especially for large volumes of medical data. Meanwhile, the privacy of images is also a critical issue. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based medical image fusion (BMIF) framework. First, to ensure fusion performance, we design a new medical image fusion model based on convolutional neural network and Inception network and integrate the proposed model into the consensus process of blockchain. Next, to save computing power of blockchain, we design a consensus mechanism by requesting consensus nodes to train the fusion model instead of calculating useless hash values in traditional blockchain. Then, to protect data privacy, we further present an efficient homomorphic encryption to realize the training of fusion model on encrypted medical data. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on public datasets to evaluate the feasibility and the performance of our proposed BMIF. The results exhibit that BMIF is efficient and secure, and our medical image fusion network performs better than state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has been widely deployed in various fields, such as finance, education, and public services. Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems.",

To meet the requirements on cooperation and anonymity of companies and organizations, researchers have developed a few solutions. Ring signature-based schemes allow multiple participants cooperatively to manage while preserving their individuals’ privacy. However, the solutions cannot work properly due to the increased computing complexity along with the expanded group size. In this article, we propose a Multi-center Anonymous Blockchain-based (MAB) system, with joint management for the consortium and privacy protection for the participants. To achieve that, we formalize the syntax used by the MAB system and present a general construction based on a modular design. By applying cryptographic primitives to each module, we instantiate our scheme with anonymity and decentralization. Furthermore, we carry out a comprehensive formal analysis of our exemplified scheme. A proof of concept simulation is provided to show the feasibility. The results demonstrate security and efficiency from both theoretical perspectives and practical perspectives.",

We propose a solution for scheduling distributed energy sources based on the Minimum Cut Maximum Flow theory. Blockchain is used to record transactions and reach consensus.

    "abstract": "Blockchain sharding splits a blockchain into several shards where consensus is reached at the shard level rather than over the entire blockchain. It improves transaction throughput and reduces the computational resources required of individual nodes. But a derivation of trustworthy consensus within a shard becomes an issue as the longest chain based mechanisms used in conventional blockchains can no longer be used. Instead, a vote-based consensus mechanism must be employed. However, existing vote-based Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocols do not offer sufficient security guarantees for sharded blockchains. First, when used to support consensus where only one block is allowed at a time (binary consensus), these protocols are susceptible to progress-hindering attacks (i.e., unable to reach a consensus). Second, when used to support a stronger type of consensus where multiple concurrent blocks are allowed (strong consensus), their tolerance of adversary nodes is low. This article proposes a new consensus protocol to address all these issues. We call the new protocol MWPoW+, as its basic framework is based on the existing Multiple Winners Proof of Work (MWPoW) protocol but includes new mechanisms to address the issues mentioned previously. MWPoW+ is a vote-based protocol for strong consensus, asynchronous in consensus derivation but synchronous in communication. We prove that it can tolerate up to f < n/2 adversary nodes in a n-node system as if using a binary consensus protocol and does not suffer from progress-hindering attacks.",

This article presents a catalog of architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain as a result of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on IoT and blockchain to extract the commonly reported quality attributes, design decisions, and relevant architectural tactics for the architectural design of this category of systems. Our findings are threefold:<?brk?> (i) identification of security, scalability, performance, and interoperability as the commonly reported quality attributes; (ii) a catalog of twelve architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain; and (iii) gaps in research that include tradeoffs among quality attributes and identified tactics. These tactics might provide architects and designers with different options when searching for an optimal architectural design that meets the quality attributes of interest and constraints of a system.",

    "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are introduced to improve individuals’ quality of life by offering a wide range of services. They collect a huge amount of data and exchange them with each other and the infrastructure. The collected data usually includes sensitive information about the users and the surrounding environment. Therefore, data security and privacy are among the main challenges in this industry. Blockchain, an emerging distributed ledger, has been considered by the research community as a potential solution for enhancing data security, integrity, and transparency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, despite the emphasis of governments on the transparency of personal data protection practices, CAV stakeholders have not been successful in communicating appropriate information with the end users regarding the procedure of collecting, storing, and processing their personal data, as well as the data ownership. This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the “data transparency” and “privacy” perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1) Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)? (2) How can the trade-off between transparency and privacy be addressed in blockchain-based ITS use cases?",

    "abstract": "In the United States and around the world, gun violence has become a long-standing public safety concern and a security threat, due to violent gun-related crimes, injuries, and fatalities. Although legislators and lawmakers have attempted to mitigate its threats through legislation, research on gun violence confirms the need for a comprehensive approach to gun violence prevention. This entails addressing the problem in as many ways as possible, such as through legislation, new technological advancements, re-engineering supply, and administrative protocols, among others. The research focuses on the technological, supply, and administrative aspects, in which we propose a manner of managing gun-related data efficiently from the point of manufacture/sale, as well as at points of transfers between secondary sellers for the improvement of criminal investigation processes. Making data more readily available with greater integrity will facilitate successful investigations and prosecutions of gun crimes. Currently, there is no single and uniform platform for firearm manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders involved in firearm sales, dissemination, management, and investigation. With the help of Blockchain technology, gun registry, ownership, transfers, and, most importantly, investigations, when crimes occur, can all be managed efficiently, breaking the cycle of gun violence. The identification of guns, gun tracing, and identification of gun owners/possessors rely on accuracy, integrity, and consistency in related systems to influence gun crime investigation processes. Blockchain technology, which uses a consensus-based approach to improve processes and transactions, is demonstrated in this study as a way to enhance these procedures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore and demonstrate the utility of Blockchain for gun-related criminal investigations using a design science approach.",

However, conventional voting systems tend to be centralized, which are known to suffer from security and efficiency limitations. Hence, there has been a trend of moving to decentralized voting systems, such as those based on blockchain. The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities. Hopefully, this survey will provide an in-depth insight into the potential utility of blockchain in voting systems and device future research agenda.",

    "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large-scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic distributed network has been formed among IoT devices. There is an extreme need to establish a trust mechanism between devices, and blockchain can provide a zero-trust security framework for IoT. However, the efficiency of the blockchain is far from meeting the application requirements of the IoT, which has become the biggest resistance to the application of the blockchain in the IoT. Therefore, this paper combines sharding to build an effective Blockchain-based IoT data storage scheme (S-BDS). Sharding can solve the problem of blockchain capacity and scalability. While the blockchain provides data immutability and traceability for the IoT, it also brings huge demands for data credibility verification. The communication delay in the IoT system seriously affects the security of the system, while the Merkle proof of traditional blockchain occupies a lot of communication resources. This paper constructs Insertable Vector Commitment (IVC) in the bilinear group and replaces the Merkle tree with IVC to store IoT data in the blockchain. The construct has small-sized proof. It also has the ability to record the number of updates, which can prevent replay-attacks. Experiments show that each block processes 1,000 transactions, the proof size of a single data piece is 30% of the original scheme, and proofs from different shards can be aggregated. IVC can effectively reduce communication congestion and improve the stability and security of the IoT system.",

    "abstract": "Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.",

    "abstract": "The blockchain technology has been gaining an increasing popularity for the last years, and smart contracts are being used for a growing number of applications in several scenarios. The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this article proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management (L2DART), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The rise of fast communication media both at the core and at the edge has resulted in unprecedented numbers of sophisticated and intelligent wireless IoT devices. Tactile Internet has enabled the interaction between humans and machines within their environment to achieve revolutionized solutions both on the move and in real-time. Many applications such as intelligent autonomous self-driving, smart agriculture and industrial solutions, and self-learning multimedia content filtering and sharing have become attainable through cooperative, distributed, and decentralized systems, namely, volunteer computing. This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and service composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource, computing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to be made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain technology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high reward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays, and balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT device availability.",

    "abstract": "Applying peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to online video games has already attracted both academic and industrial interests, since it removes the need for expensive server maintenance. However, there are two major issues preventing the use of a P2P architecture, namely how to provide an effective distributed data storage solution, and how to tackle potential cheating behaviors. Inspired by emerging blockchain techniques, we propose a novel consensus model called Proof-of-Play (PoP) to provide a decentralized data storage system that incorporates an anti-cheating mechanism for P2P games, by rewarding players that interact with the game as intended, along with consideration of security measures to address the Nothing-at-stake Problem and the Long-range Attack. To validate our design, we utilize a game-theory model to show that under certain assumptions, the integrity of the PoP system would not be undermined due to the best interests of any user. Then, as a proof-of-concept, we developed a P2P game (Infinity Battle) to demonstrate how a game can be integrated with PoP in practice. Finally, experiments were conducted to study PoP in comparison with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to show its advantages in various aspects.",

First, the Patient-oriented Privacy Preserving Access Control model is introduced into the access control process of private information in medical systems. Next, a private information storage platform is built by using blockchain technology, and information transmission is realized using standard cryptographic algorithms. In this process, file authorization contracts are also used to guarantee the security of private information and further prevent theft of medical private information. Our simulation results show that the storage response time of this method is kept below 1,000 ms, and the maximum information throughput rate reaches 550 kbit/s, which indicates that this method has strong performance in information storage and transmission efficiency. Moreover, the reliability and bandwidth utilization of data transmission across domains is higher, so the method has higher information security control performance and superior overall performance.",

This imposes the risk of single point of failures, monopoly, and bribery. In this article, we aim to tackle this problem by proposing a novel decentralized and trustless framework for iterative double auction based on blockchain. Our design adopts the smart contract and state channel technologies to enable a double auction process among parties that do not need to trust each other, while minimizing the blockchain transactions. In specific, we propose an extension to the original concept of state channels that can support multiparty computation. Then, we provide a formal development of the proposed framework and prove the security of our design against adversaries. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework using Elixir and Solidity, on which we conduct various experiments to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have shown significant success in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, our model gains superior estimation performance.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as ÐApps. When engineering ÐApps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective ÐApps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., ÐApp developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this article, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57 seconds and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8 minutes. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan’s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for the very cheap and cheap transactions. EthGasStation’s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, ÐApp developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an annotated portfolio of projects that seek to understand and communicate the social and societal implications of blockchains, DLTs and smart contracts. These complex technologies rely on human and technical factors to deliver cryptocurrencies, shared computation and trustless protocols but have a secondary benefit in providing a moment to re-think many aspects of society, and imagine alternative possibilities. The projects use design and HCI methods to relate blockchains to a range of topics, including global supply chains, delivery infrastructure, smart grids, volunteering and charitable giving, through engaging public, exploring ideas and speculating on possible futures. Based on an extensive annotated portfolio we draw out learning for the design of blockchain systems, broadening participation and surfacing questions around imaginaries, social implications and engagement with new technology. This paints a comprehensive picture of how HCI and design can shape understandings of the future of complex technologies.",

    "abstract": "With social media becoming the most frequently used mode of modern-day communications, the propagation of fake or vicious news through such modes of communication has emerged as a serious problem. The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-and-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and bloXroute servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms. The proposed work is a framework for solving fake or vicious news spread problems on social media; the complete design specifications are beyond scope of the current work and will be addressed in the future.",

    "abstract": "E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare-related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low-power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in, or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications that are related to healthcare, such as “body automation,” “healthcare,” “medical monitoring,” “body interaction,” and “medical implants (i.e., pacemaker).” Most of the communications happen in IoMT-based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security-related attacks, i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT-based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual, as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT-based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this article, we propose a blockchain-enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT-based e-healthcare system that is named as “BACKM-EHA” in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard, i.e., “Real-Or-Random model.” The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks. The performance of BACKM-EHA is better than the other existing schemes, as it requires less communication cost, computation cost, and provides more “security and functionality features.”",

    "abstract": "In migrating and upgrading an Ethereum smart contract, it is necessary to transfer both the code as well as the stored data. Various methods attempt to migrate or upgrade a smart contract, but they are mostly manual, error-prone, and applicable only before deployment. Further, they have challenges in extracting the storage state of complex mapping data structures along with their keys. In this work, we present Smartmuv as an automatic source-code-based static analysis tool to analyze and extract the state from the storage-trie of smart contracts. Based on the abstract syntax tree and the control flow graphs of the Solidity source code, the tool analyzes each state variable including mapping types along the inheritance hierarchy. It also provides the upgrade algorithm that initializes the extracted state in the constructor of new smart contract. Smartmuv safely approximates the origin of the keys used in the mapping to extract values and has been able to extract the mapping state of 23,673 smart contracts with 95.7% overall precision. Moreover, we also validate the Smartmuv’s extracted state with the third-party tool Etherscan.",

    "abstract": "Green Internet of things (GIoT) generally refers to a new generation of Internet of things design concept. It can save energy and reduce emissions, reduce environmental pollution, waste of resources, and harm to human body and environment, in which green smart device (GSD) is a basic unit of GIoT for saving energy. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous bottom-layer GSDs in GIoT, user access and control of GSDs have become more and more complicated. Since there is no unified GSD management system, users need to operate different GIoT applications and access different GIoT cloud platforms when accessing and controlling these heterogeneous GSDs. This fragmented GSD management model not only increases the complexity of user access and control for heterogeneous GSDs, but also reduces the scalability of GSDs applications. To address this issue, this article presents a blockchain-empowered general GSD access control framework, which provides users with a unified GSD management platform. First, based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) decentralized identifiers (DIDs) standard, users and GSD are issued visual identity (VID). Then, we extended the GSD-DIDs protocol to authenticate devices and users. Finally, based on the characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering of blockchain, a unified access control system for GSD was designed, including the registration, granting, and revoking of access rights. We implement and test on the Raspberry Pi device and the FISCO-BCOS alliance chain. The experimental results prove that the framework provides a unified and feasible way for users to achieve decentralized, lightweight, and fine-grained access control of GSDs. The solution reduces the complexity of accessing and controlling GSDs, enhances the scalability of GSD applications, as well as guarantees the credibility and immutability of permission data and identity data during access.",

    "abstract": "Employee data can be used to facilitate work, but their misusage may pose risks for individuals. Inverse transparency therefore aims to track all usages of personal data, allowing individuals to monitor them to ensure accountability for potential misusage. This necessitates a trusted log to establish an agreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of blockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For power asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain is especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues remain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and attest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely, lacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy legislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a liability. After a rightful request, an individual’s personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum blockchain has shown great potential in providing the next generation of the decentralized platform beyond crypto payments. Recently, it has attracted researchers and industry players to experiment with developing various Web3 applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), Defi, Metaverse, and many more. Although Ethereum provides a secure platform for developing decentralized applications, it is not immune to security risks and has been a victim of numerous cyber attacks. Adversarial attacks are a new cyber threat to systems that have been rising. Adversarial attacks can disrupt and exploit decentralized applications running on the Ethereum platform by creating fake accounts and transactions. Detecting adversarial attacks is challenging because the fake materials (e.g., accounts and transactions) as malicious payloads are similar to benign data. This article proposes a model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for cyber threat hunting in the Ethereum blockchain. Firstly, we employ GAN to generate fake transactions using genuine Ethereum transactions as the first phase of the proposed model. Then in the second phase, we utilize bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to identify adversarial transactions in a hunting exercise. The results of the first phase evaluation show that the GAN can generate transactions identical to the actual Ethereum transactions with an accuracy of 82.51%. Also, the results of the second phase show 99.98% accuracy in identifying adversarial transactions.",

    "abstract": "Public auditing and data deduplication are integral considerations in providing efficient and secure cloud storage services. Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.",

The requirements on these networks and their usage, however, can differ significantly from traditional communication networks, with implications on all layers of the protocol stack. This article is motivated by these differences and, in particular, by the observation that many fundamental design aspects of these networks are not well-understood today. To support the networking community to contribute to this emerging application domain, we present a structured overview of the field, from topology and neighbor discovery, over block and transaction propagation, to sharding and off-chain networks, also reviewing existing empirical results from different measurement studies. In particular, for each of these domains, we provide the context, highlighting differences and commonalities with traditional networks, review the state-of-the-art, and identify open research challenges. Our article can hence also be seen as a call-to-arms to improve the foundation on top of which blockchains are built.",

    "abstract": "Multi-organization data sharing is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the interconnectivity of systems and the need for collaboration across organizations (e.g., exchange of data in a supply chain involving multiple upstream and downstream vendors). There are, however, data security concerns due to lack of trust between organizations that may be located in jurisdictions with varying security and privacy legislation and culture (also referred to as a zero trust environment). Hence, in such a zero trust setting, one should introduce strengthened, yet efficient, access control mechanisms to facilitate cross-organizational data access and exchange requests. Contemporary access control schemes generally focus on protecting a single objective rather than multiple parties, due to higher security costs. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme, designed to facilitate lightweight data sharing among different organizations. Specifically, our approach utilizes the consortium blockchain to establish a trustworthy environment, in which a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is then deployed using our proposed multi-signature protocol and smart contract methods. Evaluation of our proposed approach is performed on the HyperLedger Fabric consortium blockchain platform using both Caliper and BFT-SMaRT benchmarks, and the findings demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at https://github.com/ceyonur/electanon.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.",

Since reciprocal activities among both familiar/unfamiliar strangers and acquaintances are quite common in PSN, it is essential to offer trust information to PSN users. Past work normally evaluates trust based on a centralized party, which is not feasible due to the dynamic changes of PSN topology and its specific characteristics. The literature still lacks a decentralized trust evaluation scheme in PSN. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized system for trust evaluation in PSN, called Social-Chain. Considering mobile devices normally lack computing resources to process cryptographic puzzle calculation, we design a lightweight consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Trust (PoT), which remarkably improves system effectivity compared with other blockchain systems. Serious security analysis and experimental results further illustrate the security and efficiency of Social-Chain for being feasibly applied into PSN.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology, whose most successful application is Bitcoin, enables non-repudiation and non-tamperable online transactions without the participation of a trusted central party. As a global ledger, the blockchain achieves the consistency of replica stored on each node through a consensus mechanism. A well-designed consensus mechanism, on one hand, needs to be efficient to meet the high frequency of online transactions. For example, the existing electronic payment systems can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Bitcoin can only handle an average of about 3TPS. On the other hand, it needs to have good security and high fault tolerance; that is, in the case when some nodes are captured by adversaries, the network can still operate normally. In this article, we establish a reputation system, called RTChain, to be integrated into the e-commerce blockchain to achieve a distributed consensus and transaction incentives. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, an incentive mechanism is used to influence the consensus behavior of nodes and the transaction behavior of users, which in turn influence the reputation scores of both nodes and users. That is, when a node correctly processes a transaction, it will receive the corresponding reputation value as a reward, and the reputation value will be reduced as punishment not only when the node is dishonest and violates the consensus agreement but also the transaction is not completed as required. Just like electronic transactions in the real world, the higher the reputation of the user, the more likely it is to be selected as the transaction partner. A user with a low reputation will be gradually eliminated in our system because it is difficult to complete the transaction. Second, RTChain uses a verifiable random function to generate the leader in each round, which guarantees fairness for all participants and, unlike PoW, does not consume a large amount of computing resources. Then our consensus mechanism selects the nodes with high reputation scores to reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus, thus improving the consensus efficiency, so that RTChain’s throughput can reach 4,000TPS. Third, we built a reputation chain to implement the distributed storage and management of reputation. Finally, our consensus mechanism is secure against existing attacks, such as flash attacks, selfish mining attacks, eclipse attacks, and double spending attacks, and allows nodes that participate in the consensus to fail, as long as the reputation of the failure node does not exceed one-third of the total reputation. We build a prototype of RTChain, and the experimental results show that RTChain is promising and deployable for e-commerce blockchains.",

However, we think that a comprehensive survey toward the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.",

    "abstract": "Different malicious activities occur in cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Some activities are due to the exploitation of vulnerabilities which are present in the blockchain infrastructure, some activities target its users through social engineering techniques, while some activities use it to facilitate different malicious activities. Since cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide pseudonymity to its users, bad actors prefer to carry out transactions related to malicious activities on them. Towards this, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts as suspects that indulge in malicious activities, thus reducing the unintended support that cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide to malicious actors. We first use the cosine similarity (CS) metrics to study the similarities between the feature vector of accounts associated with different malicious activities and find that most of the malicious activities associated with the Ethereum blockchain behave similarly. We then use the K-Means clustering algorithm to check if accounts associated with similar malicious activities cluster together. We also study the effect of bias on the performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm, due to the number of accounts associated with malicious activity. We then compare the different state-of-the-art models and identify that Neural Networks (NNs) are resistant to bias associated with a malicious activity and are also robust against adversarial attacks. The previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts also show bias towards an over-represented malicious activity.",

    "abstract": "The digital transformation of the medical sector requires solutions that are convenient and efficient for all stakeholders while protecting patients’ sensitive data. One example that has already attracted design-oriented research are medical prescriptions. However, current implementations of electronic prescription management systems typically create centralized data silos, leaving user data vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and impeding interoperability. Research has also proposed decentralized solutions based on blockchain technology, but privacy-related challenges have often been ignored. We conduct design science research to develop and implement a system for the exchange of electronic prescriptions that builds on two blockchains and a digital wallet app. Our solution combines the bilateral, verifiable, and privacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and pharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized double-spending check. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as a security analysis suggest that this architecture can improve existing approaches to electronic prescription management by offering patients control over their data by design, a high level of security, sufficient performance and scalability, and interoperability with emerging digital identity management solutions for users, businesses, and institutions. We also derive principles on how to design decentralized, privacy-oriented information systems that require both the exchange of sensitive information and double-usage protection.",

Many blockchains are programmable, supporting smart contracts, which maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the state. Unfortunately, bugs in many smart contracts have been exploited by hackers. Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We integrated a permissions system that encodes a notion of ownership to allow for safe, flexible aliasing. We describe two case studies that evaluate Obsidian’s applicability to the domains of parametric insurance and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian’s type system facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of resources. We compared our Obsidian implementation to a Solidity implementation, observing that the Solidity implementation requires much boilerplate checking and tracking of state, whereas Obsidian does this work statically.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) has become the backbone of innumerable multimedia applications in various fields. The wide application of IoMT not only makes our life convenient but also brings challenges to service discovery. Service discovery aims to leverage location information and trust evidence scattered in a variety of multimedia applications to find trusted IoMT devices that can provide specific service in target areas. However, the eavesdropping and tampering to these sensitive IoMT data during the trust propagation process invalidate the service discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose Secure Service Discovery (SSD) for IoMT using cross-blockchain-enabled fog computing. To resist the tampering and eavesdropping during the trust propagation process, a scalable cross-blockchain structure consisting of multiple parallel blockchains is first proposed based on fog, in which different parallel blockchains can be orchestrated to propagate encrypted location information and trust evidence of different applications. Moreover, to enable a cross-blockchain structure to leverage encrypted location information and trust evidence to find trusted IoMT devices in preset areas, a novel privacy-preserving range query is proposed to query and aggregate trust evidence. Security analysis and simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the proposed SSD.",

    "abstract": "Korean education-related evaluation agencies utilize a centralized system that directly manages learner data. This leaves the intellectual property of the organizations and the personal information of the students vulnerable to leakage should the central server be attacked. In this study, the researchers propose a multilateral personal portfolio authentication system that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and transparency of the data such as learner's schooling history. The system uses the features of blockchain in a distributed network wherein a learner submits schooling data to a peer in the network. The data is then verified through an agreement among the peers and recorded in a chronologically encrypted ledger. The proposed system is implemented based on Hyperledger Fabric and the analysis thereof conducted by evaluating its processing speed, capacity, and security. The analysis indicates that the system is able to successfully intercept the transactions of unvalidated users, thereby preventing the recording of incorrect data by an unauthorized user. Furthermore, it provides a record of previously made changes to a learner's profile, thus improving the integrity and reliability of the data. This system provides a platform to share learner information safely and promptly among schools, certification authorities, and higher learning institutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, most of the Internet of things (IoT) infrastructures are highly centralized with single points of failure, which results in serious security and privacy issues of IoT data. Fortunately, blockchain technique can provide a decentralized and secure IoT framework to deal with security issues based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, openness, transparency, and traceability. However, the blockchain consensus protocol guarantees the safety and reliability of data, but it also brings problems such as scalability limitations and poor storage extensibility, resulting in the inability to directly integrate blockchain and the IoT in existing conditions. In this article, a private three-tier local blockchain, Three-tier architecture Blockchain (TBchain), is proposed to solve the problem by splitting part of the transactions in the public blockchain and locking them in a higher-level blockchain TBchain. Additionally, the private blockchain TBchain is connected to the public blockchain to build a hierarchical blockchain network to provide privacy protection for the IoT data stored on the blockchain. Finally, we implement an IoT framework based on TBchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to realize the decentralized IoT, which guarantees the user’s access control right to personal data. Experimental results show that the IoT framework based on TBchain and IPFS realizes the user’s access control right to personal data by verifying in advance to ensure the confidentiality and security of shared data, and improves the security and privacy of IoT data and transactions. Moreover, we prove that the scalability and storage extensibility of the blockchain is positively correlated with the number of data blocks in TBchain.",

    "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has become a prominent paradigm to collect and share data based on sensing devices with built-in sensors in the Internet of Things era. Nevertheless, conventional MCS confronts various security and privacy vulnerabilities in terms of decentralized, openness, and non-dedicated properties. Currently, the submitted tasks are collected and managed conventionally by a centralized MCS platform. A centralized MCS platform is not safe enough to protect and prevent tampering sensing tasks since it confronts the single point of failure, which reduces the effectiveness and robustness of the MCS system. Meanwhile, fake task attack is a serious threat, as it would drain excessive resources from the participant devices and clog the MCS servers to disrupt the services offered by the MCS. To address the centralized issue and identify fake tasks, a blockchain-based decentralized MCS is designed. Integration of blockchain into MCS enables a decentralized framework. Moreover, the distributed nature of a blockchain chain prevents sensing tasks from being tampered. The blockchain uses a practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus that can tolerate one-third faulty nodes, making the implemented MCS system robust and sturdy. In addition, an ensemble learning approach is deployed in the blockchain for eliminating fake tasks by malicious requesters. The evaluation test is conducted under two different datasets representing a big city and a small one to have an MCS campaign. Numerical results show that the ensemble approach eliminates most of the fake tasks with a detection accuracy of up to 0.99. Furthermore, the ensemble learning integrated system outperforms individual learner based centralized systems, and non-fault tolerant systems in terms of Ratio of Legitimate Tasks (RoLT) saved and Ratio of Fake Tasks (RoFT). RoFT is low to 0.01, and RoLT is high up to 0.913 via the proposed MCS blockchain-driven framework.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication platform provides seamless information exchange facilities in a dynamic mobile city environment. Heterogeneous communication is a common medium for information exchange through autonomous resources distributed and accessed using infrastructure units. Cyber-security is a primary concern in accessing autonomous information from the distributed resources due to anonymity and different types of targeted adversaries. This article proposes token-based authorization and authentication (TAA) for securing IoV communications. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology and random forest learning for authorization and key management for authentication, respectively. In this process, frequent change in tokens and key update features are restricted in a view to maximize the seamlessness in information exchange. Authentication is preceded by knowledge of the data classification without errors to prevent additional overhead. Blockchain-based authorization helps to update specific fields of the tokens to retain the communication ratio by reducing vehicle-to-vehicle losses. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using appropriate simulations for these metrics by varying vehicle density, error rate, and classification sets.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual’s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant’s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain’s challenges. Further, a Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture with two layers of participation is presented, which improves the global model accuracy and guarantees participant’s privacy. It leverages the channel mechanism of Blockchain for parallel model training and distribution. It facilitates establishing decentralized trust between the participants and the gateways using the Blockchain, which helps to have only honest participants.",

    "abstract": "Malware detection approaches have been extensively studied for traditional software systems. However, the development of blockchain technology has promoted the birth of a new type of software system–decentralized applications. Composed of smart contracts, a type of application that implements the Ponzi scheme logic (called smart Ponzi schemes) has caused irreversible loss and hindered the development of blockchain technology. These smart contracts generally had a short life but involved a large amount of money. Whereas identification of these Ponzi schemes before causing financial loss has been significantly important, existing methods suffer from three main deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient dataset, the reliance on the transaction records, and the low accuracy. In this study, we first build a larger dataset. Then, a large number of features from multiple views, including bytecode, semantic, and developers, are extracted. These features are independent of the transaction records. Furthermore, we leveraged machine learning methods to build our identification model, i.e., Multi-view Cascade Ensemble model (MulCas). The experiment results show that MulCas can achieve higher performance and robustness in the scope of our dataset. Most importantly, the proposed method can identify smart Ponzi scheme at the creation time.",

    "abstract": "The problem of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) has received a lot of attention in the last 30 years. Due to the popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains in recent years, several BFT protocols have been deployed in the large scale of Internet environment. We analyze several popular BFT protocols such as Capser FFG/CBC-FBC for Ethereum 2.0 and GRANDPA for Polkadot. Our analysis shows that the security models for these BFT protocols are slightly different from the models commonly accepted in the academic literature. For example, we show that, if the adversary has a full control of the message delivery order in the underlying network, then none of the BFT protocols for Ethereum blockchain 2.0 and Polkadot blockchain could achieve liveness even in a synchronized network. Though it is not clear whether a practical adversary could actually control and re-order the underlying message delivery system (at Internet scale) to mount these attacks, it raises an interesting question on security model gaps between academic BFT protocols and deployed BFT protocols in the Internet scale. With these analysis, this article proposes a Casper CBC-FBC style binary BFT protocol and shows its security in the traditional academic security model with complete asynchronous networks. For partial synchronous networks, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol BDLS based on the seminal DLS protocol and show that it is one of the most efficient practical BFT protocols at large scale networks in the traditional academic BFT security model. The implementation of BDLS is available at https://github.com/yonggewang/bdls. Finally, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol XP for complete asynchronous networks and show its security in the traditional academic BFT security model.",

    "abstract": "Outsourcing helps relocate data from the cyber-physical system (CPS) for efficient storage at low cost. Current server-based outsourcing mainly focuses on the benefits of servers. This cannot attract users well, as their security, efficiency, and economy are not guaranteed. To solve with this issue, a hybrid outsourcing model that exploits both cloud server and edge devices to store data is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of security and efficiency are different under specific scenarios. There is a lack of a comprehensive solution that considers all of the above issues. In this work, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first hybrid user-centric data outsourcing (HUCDO) scheme. It allows users to outsource data securely, efficiently, and economically via different CPSs. Brielly, our contributions consist of theories, implementations, and evaluations. Our theories include the first homomorphic collision-resistant chameleon hash (HCCH) and homomorphic designated-receiver signcryption (HDRS). As implementations, we instantiate how to use our proposals to outsource small- or large-scale data through distinct CPS, respectively. Additionally, a blockchain with proof-of-discrete-logarithm (B-PoDL) is instantiated to help improve our performance. Last, as demonstrated by our evaluations, our proposals are secure, efficient, and economic for users to implement while outsourcing their data via CPSs.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum, a blockchain, supports its own cryptocurrency named Ether and smart contracts. Although more than 8M smart contracts have been deployed on Ethereum, little is known about the characteristics of its users, smart contracts, and the relationships among them. We conduct the first systematic study on Ethereum by leveraging graph analysis to characterize three major activities on Ethereum, namely money transfer, smart contract creation, and smart contract invocation. We collect all transaction data, construct three graphs from the data to characterize major activities via graph analysis, and discover new insights. Moreover, we address three security issues based on graphs.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, a number of blockchain-based online platforms decided to use consensus procedures other than Proof of Work (PoW), originally adopted by Bitcoin. An alternative protocol, which attracted much attention, is the so-called Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which unlike PoW consensus is not based on solving an energy-consuming cryptopuzzle, but rather on the amount of currency units owned by a user. Different platforms adopted alternative versions of PoS. In this article, we investigate a version of PoS inspired by Algorand, which embodies a number of specific features. Indeed, to confirm a new block in the chain Algorand introduces three steps: proposal, selection, and confirmation of a block. Each step is performed by randomly selected users, where draws are based on PoS. We find explicit solutions for individual money demand, under the main simplifying assumption that a user is rewarded by the system only for the first role that she's drawn for. We do so by considering both exogenous and endogenous money supply. We also discuss the monetary equilibrium of the system, an important element in the analysis because a long-lasting disequilibrium of the economy may cause disappointment and induce some users to leave the system. Our findings suggest that an equilibrium seems to be more likely to take place if users have heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, preferences.",

    "abstract": "Software-defined networks offer flexible and intelligent network operations by splitting a traditional network into a centralized control plane and a programmable data plane. The controller in the control plane is the fundamental element used to manage all operations of the data plane. Hence, the performance and capabilities of the controller itself are essential in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities. This work uses three benchmarking tools to compare 9 controllers and presents a detailed analysis of their performance, along with discussion on performance of specialized network controllers.",

    "abstract": "The transaction-rate bottleneck built into popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, leads to fee markets where transactions are included according to a first-price auction for block space. Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries. We find that our Machine Learning (ML) model can predict fee volatility with an accuracy of up to 91%. Our findings enable Bitcoin users to improve their fee expenses and the approval time for their transactions.",

    "abstract": "Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been leveraged for defining decentralized economies for the (commercial or private) trade of virtual and physical assets, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formalize proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, unlike existing non-consensus solutions, which are prone to be more compute-time and audit-time intensive, we present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive, through a stochastic game analysis, block proposal strategies under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that when a majority of the consensus protocol participants are licensed by the regulator to propose legal transactions, there exists a fair consensus execution policy to maximize the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network.",

Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.",

Architectural migration is an important activity that helps to transform the architectural styles applied during a system’s design with the result of modernising the system. If not performed correctly, this process could lead to potential system failures. This article presents an automated approach to refactoring architectural design and to planning the evolution process. With our solution, the architectural design can be refactored, ensuring that system functionality is preserved. Furthermore, the architectural migration process allows the system to be safely and incrementally transformed. We have evaluated our approach with five real-world software applications. The results prove the effectiveness of our approach and identify factors that impact the performance of architectural verification and migration planning. An interesting finding is that planning algorithms generate migration plans that differ in term of their relative efficiency.",

From a curated dataset of 760 rug pulls across 10 NFT marketplaces, we examine these schemes’ structural and behavioral properties, identify the characteristics and motivations of rug pullers, and classify NFT projects into 20 groups based on creators’ association with their accounts. Our findings reveal that repeated rug pulls account for a significant proportion of the rise in NFT-related cryptocurrency crimes, with one NFT creator attempting 37 rug pulls within 3 months. Additionally, we identify the largest group of creators influencing the majority of rug pulls and demonstrate the connection between rug pullers of different NFT projects using the same wallets to store and move money. Our study contributes to understanding NFT market risks and provides insights for designing preventative strategies to mitigate future losses.",

    "abstract": "The recognition of capabilities supplied by cloud systems is presently growing. Collecting or sharing healthcare data and sensitive information especially during the Covid-19 pandemic has motivated organizations and enterprises to leverage the upsides coming from cloud-based applications. However, the privacy of electronic data in such applications remains a significant challenge for cloud vendors to adapt their solutions with existing privacy legislation standards such as general data protection regulation (GDPR). This article first proposes a formal model and verification for data usage requests of providers in a cloud composite service using a model checking tool. A cloud pharmacy scenario is presented to illustrate the connectivity of providers in the composite service and the stream of their requests for both collection and movement of patient data. A set of verifications is then undertaken over the pharmacy service in accordance with three significant GDPR obligations, namely user consent, data access, and data transfer. Following that, the article designs and implements a cloud container virtualization based on the verified formal model realizing GDPR requirements. The container makes use of some enforcement smart contracts to only proceed with the providers’ requests that are compliant with GDPR. Finally, several experiments are provided to investigate the performance of our approach in terms of time, memory, and cost.",

    "abstract": "The use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been gaining traction in recent years due to various reasons. While charging their EVs, users expose their identity and personal details, and an adversary being able to identify and track where users charge their EVs is a potential privacy threat. In this article, we propose a user-empowered privacy-preserving authentication protocol for EV charging based on Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) to provide Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-security. The proposed method gives users full control over their identities and allows them to remain anonymous while charging from any station. Giving control over their identities empowers users. At the same time, by making use of the concept of VC, other parties can verify that a user is legitimate and authenticate the user before providing charging services. Hence, the proposed protocol makes the charging service available in a secure way, while empowering users and preserving their privacy.",

    "abstract": "The Bitcoin payment system involves two agent types: users that transact with the currency and pay fees and miners in charge of authorizing transactions and securing the system in return for these fees. Two of Bitcoin’s challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin’s pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the “monopolistic auction” [16], showing (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one’s value) diminishes as the number of bids increases.",

    "abstract": "Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.",

Building AI technologies or machine-learning models often requires massive amounts of data, which may include sensitive, user private information to be collected from different sites or countries. Privacy, security, and data governance constraints rule out a brute force process in the acquisition and integration of these data. It is thus a serious challenge to protect user privacy while achieving high-performance models. This article reviews recent progress of federated learning in addressing this challenge in the context of privacy-preserving computing. Federated learning allows global AI models to be trained and used among multiple decentralized data sources with high security and privacy guarantees, as well as sound incentive mechanisms. This article presents the background, motivations, definitions, architectures, and applications of federated learning as a new paradigm for building privacy-preserving, responsible AI ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task of computer vision. Most Full-Reference (FR) IQA methods have limitation in the accurate prediction of perceptual qualities of the traditional distorted images and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based distorted images. To address this issue, we propose a novel method by Unifying Dual-Attention and Siamese Transformer Network (UniDASTN) for FR-IQA. An important contribution is the spatial attention module composed of a Siamese Transformer Network and a feature fusion block. It can focus on significant regions and effectively maps the perceptual differences between the reference and distorted images to a latent distance for distortion evaluation. Another contribution is the dual-attention strategy that exploits channel attention and spatial attention to aggregate features for enhancing distortion sensitivity. In addition, a novel loss function is designed by jointly exploiting Mean Square Error (MSE), bidirectional Kullback–Leibler divergence, and rank order of quality scores. The designed loss function can offer stable training and thus enables the proposed UniDASTN to effectively learn visual perceptual image quality. Extensive experiments on standard IQA databases are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed UniDASTN. The IQA results demonstrate that the proposed UniDASTN outperforms some state-of-the-art FR-IQA methods on the LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013, and PIPAL databases.",

Here, we analyze the protocol using PRISM+, an extension of the probabilistic model checker PRISM with primitives for expressing blockchain data types. First, we extend PRISM+ to include data types and operations for modeling and analyzing Proof of Stake based consensus protocols. Then, we model Hybrid Casper in PRISM+ as a parallel composition of stochastic processes, thus precisely describing the behavior of the protocol and highlighting its corner cases. PRISM+ is therefore used to rapidly and automatically analyze the resilience of Hybrid Casper when tuning, up or down, several basic parameters of the protocol, such as the rates of creating blocks, and the strategies for determining penalties. Finally, we study the robustness of Hybrid Casper to two well-known attacks: the Eclipse attack and the majority attack.",

To address this concern, this paper first presents an identity-based public auditing scheme for cloud storage of IoV data, which can fully achieve the essential function and security requirements, such as classified auditing, multi-source auditing and privacy protection. Particularly, we design a new authenticated data structure, called data mapping table, to track the distribution of each type of IoV data to ensure fine and rapid audits. Moreover, our scheme can reduce the overheads for both the key management and the generation of block tags. We formally prove the security of the presented scheme and evaluate its performance by comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art schemes designed for traditional scenarios. The theoretical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can securely and efficiently realize public auditing for IoV data, and outperforms the previous ones in both the computation and communication overheads in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Through the collaboration of cloud and edge, cloud-edge computing allows the edge that approximates end-users undertakes those non-computationally intensive service processing of the cloud, reducing the communication overhead and satisfying the low latency requirement of Internet of Vehicle (IoV). With cloud-edge computing, the computing tasks in IoV is able to be delivered to the edge servers (ESs) instead of the cloud and rely on the deployed services of ESs for a series of processing. Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is adopted for the uploaded weights before the model aggregation on the cloud. Besides, a service deployment scheme based on deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed. Eventually, the performance of PSDF is evaluated by massive experiments.",

    "abstract": "The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.",

    "abstract": "In Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) environments, the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing paradigm can provide a more proper solution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other traditional distributed computing. Owing to the different sizes of scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model that includes shared datasets within the individual and among multiple workflows across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning–based approach to learn the data placement strategy in the runtime stage of scientific workflows. Through using the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing architecture to simulate IoT environments, we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of DYM-RL-DPS. The results of our strategy can effectively reduce the data transmission time as compared to other strategies.",

In this work, we propose a quantitative model to describe and analyze the Nakamoto consensus.

    "abstract": "Distributed ledgers (DLs) provide many advantages over centralized solutions in Internet of Things projects, including but not limited to improved security, transparency, and fault tolerance. To leverage DLs at scale, their well-known limitation (i.e., performance) should be adequately analyzed and addressed. Directed acyclic graph-based DLs have been proposed to tackle the performance and scalability issues by design. The first among them, IOTA, has shown promising signs in addressing the preceding issues. IOTA is an open source DL designed for the Internet of Things. It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, to achieve a potentially higher scalability over blockchain-based DLs. However, due to the uncertainty and centralization of the deployed consensus, the current IOTA implementation exposes some performance issues, making it less performant than the initial design. In this article, we first extend an existing simulator to support realistic IOTA simulations and investigate the impact of different design parameters on IOTA’s performance. Then, we propose a layered model to help the users of IOTA determine the optimal waiting time to resend the previously submitted but not yet confirmed transaction. Our findings reveal the impact of the transaction arrival rate, tip selection algorithms, weighted tip selection algorithm randomness, and network delay on the throughput. Using the proposed layered model, we shed some light on the distribution of the confirmed transactions. The distribution is leveraged to calculate the optimal time for resending an unconfirmed transaction to the DL. The performance analysis results can be used by both system designers and users to support their decision making.",

    "abstract": "Tokens have become an essential part of blockchain ecosystem, so recognizing token transfer behaviors is crucial for applications depending on blockchain. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot recognize token transfer behaviors accurately and efficiently because of their incomplete patterns and inefficient designs. This work proposes TokenAware, a novel online system for recognizing token transfer behaviors. To improve accuracy, TokenAware infers token transfer behaviors from modifications of internal bookkeeping of a token smart contract for recording the information of token holders (e.g., their addresses and shares). However, recognizing bookkeeping is challenging, because smart contract bytecode does not contain type information. TokenAware overcomes the challenge by first learning the instruction sequences for locating basic types and then deriving the instruction sequences for locating sophisticated types that are composed of basic types. To improve efficiency, TokenAware introduces four optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TokenAware with real blockchain data. Results show that TokenAware can automatically identify new types of bookkeeping and recognize 107,202 tokens with 98.7% precision. TokenAware with optimizations merely incurs 4% overhead, which is 1/345 of the overhead led by the counterpart with no optimization. Moreover, we develop an application based on TokenAware to demonstrate how it facilitates malicious behavior detection.",

    "abstract": "The vision for programmable matter is to create a material that can be reprogrammed to have different shapes and to change its physical properties on demand. They are autonomous systems composed of a huge number of independent connected elements called particles. The connections to one another form the overall shape of the system. These particles are capable of interacting with each other and take decisions based on their environment. Beyond sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, programmable matter includes actuation and motion capabilities. It could be deployed in different domains and will constitute an intelligent component of the IoT. A lot of applications can derive from this technology, such as medical or industrial applications. However, just like any other technology, security is a huge concern. Given its distributed architecture and its processing limitations, programmable matter cannot handle the traditional security protocols and encryption algorithms. This article proposes a new security protocol optimized and dedicated for IoT programmable matter. This protocol is based on lightweight cryptography and uses the same encryption protocol as a hashing function while keeping the distributed architecture in mind. The analysis and simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method and that a supercomputer will need about 5.93 × 1025 years to decrypt the message.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of mobile service composition meets the current needs for real-time eCommerce. However, the requirements for eCommerce, such as safety and timeliness, are becoming increasingly strict. Thus, the cloud-edge hybrid computing model has been introduced to accelerate information processing, especially in a mobile scenario. However, the mobile environment is characterized by limited resource storage and users who frequently move, and these characteristics strongly affect the reliability of service composition running in this environment. Consequently, applications are likely to fail if inappropriate services are invoked. To ensure that the composite service can operate normally, traditional dynamic reconfiguration methods tend to focus on cloud services scheduling. Unfortunately, most of these approaches cannot support timely responses to dynamic changes. In this article, the cloud-edge based dynamic reconfiguration to service workflow for mobile eCommerce environments is proposed. First, the service quality concept is extended. Specifically, the value and cost attributes of a service are considered. The value attribute is used to assess the stability of the service for some time to come, and the cost attribute is the cost of a service invocation. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict the stability of services, which is related to the calculation of the value attribute. Then, in view of the limited available equipment resources, a method for calculating the cost of calling a service is introduced. Third, candidate services are selected by considering both service stability and the cost of service invocation, thus yielding a dynamic reconfiguration scheme that is more suitable for the cloud-edge environment. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were carried out, and the experimental results prove that the method proposed in this article offers higher stability, less energy consumption, and more accurate service prediction.",

    "abstract": "Urban crime is an ongoing problem in metropolitan development and attracts general concern from the international community. As an effective means of defending urban safety, crime prediction plays a crucial role in patrol force allocation and public safety. However, urban crime data is a macro result of crime patterns overlapped by various irrelevant factors that cause inhomogeneous noises—local outliers and irregular waves. These noises might obstruct the learning process of crime prediction models and result in a deviation of performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel paradigm of <underline>Du</underline>al-<underline>ro</underline>bust Enhanced Spatial-temporal Learning <underline>Net</underline>work (DuroNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that possesses an adaptive robustness for reducing the effect of outliers and waves. The robustness is mainly reflected on two aspects. One is a locality enhanced module that employs local temporal context information to smooth the deviation of outliers and dynamic spatial information to assist in understanding normal points. The other is a self-attention-based pattern representation module to weaken the effect of irregular waves by learning attentive weights. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world crime datasets before and after adding Gaussian noises. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our DuroNet over the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Mobile apps have transformed many aspects of clinical practice and are becoming a commonplace in healthcare settings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for such apps to play an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. Several types of COVID-19 apps have enabled healthcare professionals and governments to communicate with the public regarding the pandemic spread, coronavirus awareness, and self-quarantine measures. While these apps provide immense benefits for the containment of the spread, privacy and security of these digital tracing apps are at the center of public debate. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of a midwestern region in the United State to assess people’s attitudes toward such apps and to examine their privacy and security concerns and preferences. Survey results from 1,550 participants indicate that privacy/security protections and trust play a vital role in people’s adoption of such apps. Furthermore, results reflect users’ preferences wanting to have control over their personal information and transparency on how their data is handled. In addition, personal data protection priorities selected by the participants were surprising and yet revealing of the disconnect between technologists and users. In this article, we present our detailed survey results as well as design guidelines for app developers to develop innovative human-centered technologies that are not only functional but also respectful of social norms and protections of civil liberties. Our study examines users’ preferences for COVID-19 apps and integrates important factors of trust, willingness, and preferences in the context of app development. Through our research findings, we suggest mechanisms for designing inclusive apps’ privacy and security measures that can be put into practice for healthcare-related apps, so that timely adoption is made possible.",

This way of writing software puts an emphasis on reuse and on composition, commoditizing the services that modern applications require. On the other hand, bugs and vulnerabilities in a single library living in one such ecosystem can affect, directly or by transitivity, a huge number of other libraries and applications. Currently, only product-level information on library dependencies is used to contain this kind of danger, but this knowledge often reveals itself too imprecise to lead to effective (and possibly automated) handling policies. We will discuss how fine-grained function-level dependencies can greatly improve reliability and reduce the impact of vulnerabilities on the whole software ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "With the evolvement of the Internet of things (IoT), privacy and security have become the primary indicators for users to deploy IoT applications. In the gateway-based IoT architecture, gateways aggregate data collected by perception-layer devices and upload message packets to platforms, while platforms automatically push different categories of data to different applications. However, security in processes of data transmission via gateways, storage in platforms, access by applications is the major challenge for user privacy protection. To tackle this challenge, this article presents a secure IoT scheme based on a fine-grained multi-receive signcryption scheme to realize end-to-end secure transmission and data access control. To enhance the security of online application decryption keys, we design a distributed threshold decryption scheme based on secret-sharing. Moreover, from the provable security perspective, we demonstrate that the scheme can achieve the expected IND-CCA security and EUF-CMA security. After the performance analysis, evaluation results show that the computational performance is efficient and linearly subject to the number of messages and the number of receivers.",

Some attempts have been made to solve the problem of user-node interaction for blockchains in which leaders assemble users’ transactions into blocks, but in the case of leaderless DAG-based ledgers such as IOTA, many of these solutions cannot be applied due to the absence of a shared mempool and the ability of nodes to issue blocks in parallel. In this work, we propose a user-node interaction mechanism for ledgers of this kind that is designed to balance user traffic across nodes and ensure the risk of a user experiencing a poor quality of service is low. Our mechanism involves users selecting nodes to issue their transactions to the ledger based on quality of service indicators advertised by the nodes.

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth in the number of IoT devices, ensuring the integrity of the massive data generated by these devices has become an important issue. Due to the limitation of hardware, most past data integrity verification schemes randomly select partial data blocks and then perform integrity validation on those blocks instead of examining the entire dataset. This will result in that unsampled data blocks cannot be detected even if they are tampered with. To solve this problem, we propose a new and effective integrity auditing mechanism of sensor data based on a bilinear map accumulator. Using the proposed approach will examine all the data blocks in the dataset, not just some of the data blocks, thus, eliminating the possibility of any cloud manipulation. Compared with other schemes, our proposed solution has been proved to be highly secure for all necessary security requirements, including tag forgery, data deletion, replacement, replay, and data leakage attacks. The solution reduces the computational and storage costs of cloud storage providers and verifiers, and also supports dynamic operations for data owners to insert, delete, and update data by using a tag index table (TIT). Compared with existing schemes based on RSA accumulator, our scheme has the advantages of fast verification and witness generation and no need to map data blocks to prime numbers. The new solution supports all the characteristics of a data integrity verification scheme.",

The framework targets three main aspects: trust assessment, trust information credibility and accuracy, and trust information storage. We harness the usage patterns of IoT consumers to offer a trust assessment that adapts to IoT consumers’ uses. Additionally, our framework ascertains the credibility and accuracy of trust-related information before trust assessment. This is achieved by validating the data collected by IoT consumers and providers. In addition, our framework ensures the contextual fairness between IoT services and trust information.

    "abstract": "The emergence of ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) environments has increased the risk of undesired access to individuals’ physical space or their information, anytime and anywhere, raising potentially serious privacy concerns. Individuals lack awareness and control of the vulnerabilities in everyday contexts and need support and care in regulating disclosures to their physical and digital selves. Existing GUI-based solutions, however, often feel physically interruptive, socially disruptive, time-consuming and cumbersome. To address such challenges, we investigate the user interaction experience and discuss the need for more tangible and embodied interactions for effective and seamless natural privacy management in everyday UbiComp settings. We propose the Privacy Care interaction framework, which is rooted in the literature of privacy management and tangible computing. Keeping users at the center, Awareness and Control are established as the core parts of our framework. This is supported with three interrelated interaction tenets: Direct, Ready-to-Hand, and Contextual. Direct refers to intuitiveness through metaphor usage. Ready-to-Hand supports granularity, non-intrusiveness, and ad hoc management, through periphery-to-center style attention transitions. Contextual supports customization through modularity and configurability. Together, they aim to provide experience of an embodied privacy care with varied interactions that are calming and yet actively empowering. The framework provides designers of such care with a basis to refer to, to generate effective tangible tools for privacy management in everyday settings.",

    "abstract": "Mobile apps have transformed many aspects of clinical practice and are becoming a commonplace in healthcare settings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for such apps to play an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. Several types of COVID-19 apps have enabled healthcare professionals and governments to communicate with the public regarding the pandemic spread, coronavirus awareness, and self-quarantine measures. While these apps provide immense benefits for the containment of the spread, privacy and security of these digital tracing apps are at the center of public debate. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of a midwestern region in the United State to assess people’s attitudes toward such apps and to examine their privacy and security concerns and preferences. Survey results from 1,550 participants indicate that privacy/security protections and trust play a vital role in people’s adoption of such apps. Furthermore, results reflect users’ preferences wanting to have control over their personal information and transparency on how their data is handled. In addition, personal data protection priorities selected by the participants were surprising and yet revealing of the disconnect between technologists and users. In this article, we present our detailed survey results as well as design guidelines for app developers to develop innovative human-centered technologies that are not only functional but also respectful of social norms and protections of civil liberties. Our study examines users’ preferences for COVID-19 apps and integrates important factors of trust, willingness, and preferences in the context of app development. Through our research findings, we suggest mechanisms for designing inclusive apps’ privacy and security measures that can be put into practice for healthcare-related apps, so that timely adoption is made possible.",

    "abstract": "Modern software development is increasingly dependent on components, libraries, and frameworks coming from third-party vendors or open-source suppliers and made available through a number of platforms (or forges). This way of writing software puts an emphasis on reuse and on composition, commoditizing the services that modern applications require. On the other hand, bugs and vulnerabilities in a single library living in one such ecosystem can affect, directly or by transitivity, a huge number of other libraries and applications. Currently, only product-level information on library dependencies is used to contain this kind of danger, but this knowledge often reveals itself too imprecise to lead to effective (and possibly automated) handling policies. We will discuss how fine-grained function-level dependencies can greatly improve reliability and reduce the impact of vulnerabilities on the whole software ecosystem.",

We improve the result of Kalai et al., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction of 1/5 of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size. We additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher resilience and sub-exponential growth in size.",

In this article, we focus on enhancing the audit strategies and the privacy issues emerging from records kept for audit purposes. We propose enhanced audit and collaboration strategies, for which experimental results, on a real online social network graph with simulated sharing behavior, show an improvement in the detection rate of bad behavior of more than 50% compared to the basic model. We also provide an analysis of the related privacy issues and discuss possible privacy-preserving alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state-machine replication makes it possible to design systems that are resilient against arbitrary faults, a requirement considered crucial for an increasing number of use cases such as permissioned blockchains, firewalls, and SCADA systems. Unfortunately, the strong fault-tolerance guarantees provided by BFT replication protocols come at the cost of a high complexity, which is why it is inherently difficult to correctly implement BFT systems in practice. This is all the more true with regard to the plethora of solutions and ideas that have been developed in recent years to improve performance, availability, or resource efficiency. This survey aims at facilitating the task of building BFT systems by presenting an overview of state-of-the-art techniques and analyzing their practical implications, for example, with respect to applicability and composability. In particular, this includes problems that arise in the context of concrete implementations, but which are often times passed over in literature. Starting with an in-depth discussion of the most important architectural building blocks of a BFT system (i.e., clients, agreement protocol, execution stage), the survey then focuses on selected approaches and mechanisms addressing specific tasks such as checkpointing and recovery.",

Among the vast array of security issues plaguing the emerging IoT, we decide to focus on access control, as privacy, trust, and other security properties cannot be achieved without controlled access. This article classifies IoT access control solutions from the literature according to their architecture (e.g., centralized, hierarchical, federated, distributed) and examines the suitability of each one for access control purposes. Our analysis concludes that important properties such as auditability and revocation are missing from many proposals while hierarchical and federated architectures are neglected by the community. Finally, we provide an architecture-based taxonomy and future research directions: a focus on hybrid architectures, usability, flexibility, privacy, and revocation schemes in serverless authorization.",

    "abstract": "In the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, all entities in the IoT network, whether home users or industrial things, receive data from other things to make decisions. However, in the decentralized, heterogeneous, and rapidly changing IoT network with billions of devices, deciding about where to get the services or information from is critical, especially because malicious entities can exist in such an unmanaged network. Security provisioning alone cannot solve the issue of service quality or reliability. One way to elevate security and reliability in the IoT network is to bridge the gap of trust between objects, and also between humans and objects, while taking into account the IoT network characteristics. Therefore, a proper trust management system must be established on top of the IoT network service architecture. Trust is related to the manner expected from objects in providing services and recommendations. Recommendations are the basis of decision making in every trust management system. Since trust management ideas in the IoT are still immature, the purpose of this article is to survey, analyze, and compare the approaches that have been taken in building trust management systems for the IoT. We break down the features of such systems by analysis and also do quantitative comparisons by simulation. This article is organized into two main parts. First, studies and approaches in this field are compared from four perspectives: (1) trust computation method, (2) resistance to attacks (3) adherence to the limitations of IoT networks and devices, and (4) performance of the trust management scheme. The second part is quantitative and simulates four major methods in this field and measures their performance. We also make extensive analytical comparisons to demonstrate the similarities and discrepancies of current IoT trust management schemes and extract the essence of a resilient trust management framework.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Internet-of-Things enables the development of smart applications devoted to improving the quality of life in urban and rural areas, thus fostering the creation of smart territories. However, some dislocated areas are underprivileged in providing such services due to the lack, inefficiency, or excessive cost of Internet access. Opportunistic networking techniques might aid in surmounting these problems. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on an untrusted Data Mule to carry data from an offline source to an online destination. In particular, we present a framework that enables the communication between different actors and a reward mechanism using Distributed Ledger Technologies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized File Storage. The protocol involved in bringing a Client’s message online and getting back a response is thoroughly explained in all its steps and then discussed on the most important trust and security issues. Finally, we evaluate such a protocol and the whole framework through a series of communication latency tests, an analysis of the Smart Contract usage, and simulations in which buses act as Data Mules. Our results suggest the feasibility of our proposal in a smart territory scenario.",

    "abstract": "The number of affirmed COVID-19 cases showed an enormous increase in the recent past throughout the globe. Keeping in view the catastrophic destruction of this devastating virus, there is a must-need situation to maximize the use of existing healthcare technologies such as the healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT). In healthcare, patient wearable devices are widely recognized as a dormant technology with enormous capabilities to assess and combat various diseases, e.g., cough, seizure, temperature, heartbeat, and so on. As we know, in the H-IoT, patient-wearable devices are dispersed in an infrastructure-free environment that exposes them to several private and public coercion while accumulating and transmitting high sensitive data over the wireless communication channel. Therefore, security is the main concern of these applications, and thus, the primary focus of this article to outline the limitations and challenges in the present literature from 2019 to 2021, to identify the requirements of H-IoT applications used in the context of COVID-19. Following this, we will move one step ahead to explore the current security techniques adopted in these applications. Consequently, we will identify the network architectural, cryptographic, protocols, and operational security challenges during our study to recommend viable research directions and opportunities, which could be helpful and capable to minimize the network architecture, deployment, and maintenance cost with more productive outcomes.",

The insights drawn from this framework allow for a more proactive approach to identifying cybersecurity patterns and emerging threats that will ultimately improve the collective cybersecurity posture of the modern society. To achieve this, cybersecurity-oriented content in both media and academic corpora, disseminated between 2008 and 2018, were morphologically analyzed via text mining. A total of 3,556 academic papers obtained from the top-10 highly reputable cybersecurity academic conferences, and 4,163 news articles collected from the New York Times were processed. The LDA topic modeling followed optimal perplexity and coherence scores resulted in 12 trendy topics. Next, the time-based gap between these trendy topics was analyzed to measure the correlation between media and trendy academic topics. Both convergences and divergences between the two cybersecurity corpora were identified, suggesting a strong time-based correlation between these resources. This framework demonstrates the effective use of automated techniques to provide insights about cybersecurity topics of social interest and emerging trends and informs the direction of future academic research in this field.",

    "abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) with electronic health records (EHR) is growing in popularity as a means to extract knowledge that can improve the decision-making process in healthcare. Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data. Studies also explore improvements to the aggregation mechanisms required to generate the learning model from distributed contributions and case studies with different types of medical data.",

    "abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an evolving technology that decouples the control functionality from the underlying hardware managed by the control plane. The application plane supports programmers to develop numerous applications (such as networking, management, security, etc.) that can even be executed from remote locations. Northbound interface (NBI) bridges the control and application planes to execute the third-party applications business logic. Due to the software bugs in applications and existing vulnerabilities such as illegal function calling, resource exhaustion, lack of trust, and so on, NBIs are susceptible to different attacks. Based on the extensive literature review, we have identified that the researchers and academia have mainly focused on the security of the control plane, data plane, and southbound interface (SBI). NBI, in comparison, has received far less attention. In this article, the security of the least explored, but a critical component of the SDN architecture, i.e., NBI, is analyzed. The article provides a brief overview of SDN, followed by a detailed discussion on the categories of NBI, vulnerabilities of NBI, and threats posed by malicious applications to NBI. Efforts of the researchers to counter malicious applications and NBI issues are then discussed in detail. The standardization efforts for the single acceptable NBI and security requirements of SDN by Open Networking Foundation (ONF) are also presented. The article concludes with the future research directions for the security of a single acceptable NBI.",

    "abstract": "Many practitioners in the software-intensive embedded industry often face difficulties after beginning their careers due to misalignment of the skills learned at the university with what is required in the workplace. Companies spend crucial resources to train personnel whose academic backgrounds are not only based on “computing disciplines” but also on non-computing ones. Analyzing the gap between the software industry and academia is important for three reasons: (1) for employers, hiring properly trained practitioners allows them to spend less time in training them while incorporating them more efficiently into the workforce; (2) for practitioners, knowing the most important skillset is helpful to increase their chance of employability; and (3) for academia, understanding the necessary skillset is critical to making curriculum changes. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey that yielded responses from 659 software professionals working worldwide in different roles. In this study, we only included the responses of 393 embedded software practitioners whose undergraduate degree was completed in Turkey, working in 10 countries. This article sheds light on the most important skills in the embedded software industry by presenting various cross-factor analyses. Understanding the coverage of these skills in the curriculum (mostly in Turkish universities) helps bridge the gaps, which can and should be achieved through more Industry Academia Collaborations (IACs).",

AI is a section of computer science, a new science technology that studies and develops theories, methods, and application systems used. The development of artificial intelligence technology first has a profound impact on the development of the accounting industry, which leads to the change of the demand for accounting talents. This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students’ experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields. An in-depth study of the challenges of artificial intelligence technology to accounting education is also of reference and guiding significance for the reform and development of engineering education and other fields.",

    "abstract": "Programmers who work with smart contract development often encounter challenges in reusing code from repositories. This is due to the presence of two unknowns that can lead to non-functional and functional failures. These unknowns are implicit collaborations between functions and subtle differences among similar functions. Current code mining methods can extract syntax and semantic knowledge (known knowledge), but they cannot uncover these unknowns due to a significant gap between the known and the unknown. To address this issue, we formulate knowledge acquisition as a knowledge deduction task and propose an analytic flow that uses the function clone as a bridge to gradually deduce the known knowledge into the problem-solving knowledge that can reveal the unknowns. This flow comprises five methods: clone detection, co-occurrence probability calculation, function usage frequency accumulation, description propagation, and control flow graph annotation. This provides a systematic and coherent approach to knowledge deduction. We then structure all of the knowledge into a semantic-enriched code Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrate this KG into two software engineering tasks: code recommendation and crowd-scaled coding practice checking. As a proof of concept, we apply our approach to 5,140 smart contract files available on Etherscan.io and confirm high accuracy of our KG construction steps. In our experiments, our code KG effectively improved code recommendation accuracy by 6% to 45%, increased diversity by 61% to 102%, and enhanced NDCG by 1% to 21%. Furthermore, compared to traditional analysis tools and the debugging-with-the-crowd method, our KG improved time efficiency by 30 to 380 seconds, vulnerability determination accuracy by 20% to 33%, and vulnerability fixing accuracy by 24% to 40% for novice developers who identified and fixed vulnerable smart contract functions.",

    "abstract": "Emerging IoT applications with stringent requirements on latency and data processing have posed many challenges to cloud-centric platforms for Smart Cities. Recently, Fog Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to support such new applications and handle the increasing volume of IoT data and devices. The Fog Computing paradigm is characterized by a horizontal system-level architecture where devices close to end-users and IoT devices are used for processing, storage, and networking functions. Fog Computing platforms aim to facilitate the development of applications and systems for Smart Cities by providing services and abstractions designed to integrate data from IoT devices and various information systems deployed in the city. Despite the potential of the Fog Computing paradigm, the literature still lacks a broad, comprehensive overview of what has been investigated on the use of such paradigm in platforms for Smart Cities and open issues to be addressed in future research and development. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was performed and we present a comprehensive understanding of the use of the Fog Computing paradigm in Smart Cities platforms, providing an overview of the current state of research on this topic, and identifying important gaps in the existing approaches and promising research directions.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous increment of city volume and size, a number of traffic-related urban units (e.g., vehicles, roads, buildings, etc.) are emerging rapidly, which plays a heavy burden on the scientific traffic control of smart cities. In this situation, it is becoming a necessity to utilize the sensor data from massive cameras deployed at city crossings for accurate traffic flow prediction. However, the traffic sensor data are often distributed and stored by different organizations or parties with zero trust, which impedes the multi-party sensor data sharing significantly due to privacy concerns. Therefore, it requires challenging efforts to balance the trade-off between data sharing and data privacy to enable cross-organization traffic data fusion and prediction. In light of this challenge, we put forward an accurate LSH (locality-sensitive hashing)-based traffic flow prediction approach with the ability to protect privacy. Finally, through a series of experiments deployed on a real-world traffic dataset, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency while guaranteeing sensor data privacy.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we share our experiences in designing and developing a suite of deep neural network–(DNN) based COVID-19 case detection and recognition framework. Existing pathological tests such as RT-PCR-based pathogen RNA detection from nasal swabbing seem to display low detection rates during the early stages of virus contraction. Moreover, the reliance on a few overburdened laboratories based around an epicenter capable of supplying large numbers of RT-PCR tests makes this testing method non-scalable when the rate of infections is high. Similarly, finding an effective drug or vaccine with which to combat COVID-19 requires a long time and many clinical trials. The development of pathological COVID-19 tests is hindered by shortages in the supply chain of chemical reagents necessary for testing on a large scale. This diminishes the speed of diagnosis and the ability to filter out COVID-19 positive patients from uninfected patients on a national level. Existing research has shown that DNN has been successful in identifying COVID-19 from radiological media such as CT scans and X-ray images, audio media such as cough sounds, optical coherence tomography to identify conjunctivitis and pink eye symptoms on the ocular surface, body temperature measurement using smartphone fingerprint sensors or thermal cameras, the use of live facial detection to identify safe social distancing practices from camera images, and face mask detection from camera images. We also investigate the utility of federated learning in diagnosis cases where private data can be trained via edge learning. These point-of-care modalities can be integrated with DNN-based RT-PCR laboratory test results to assimilate multiple modalities of COVID-19 detection and thereby provide more dimensions of diagnosis. Finally, we will present our initial test results, which are encouraging.",

    "abstract": "The Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model is commonly used in the field of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to transfer value between participants. One of its advantages is that it allows parallel processing of transactions, as independent transactions can be added in any order. This property of order invariance and parallelisability has potential benefits in terms of scalability. However, since the UTXO Ledger is an append-only data structure, this advantage is compromised through the presence of conflicting transactions. We propose an extended UTXO Ledger model that optimistically updates the ledger and keeps track of the dependencies of the possible conflicts. In the presence of a conflict resolution mechanism, we propose a method to reduce the extended ledger back to a consistent UTXO Ledger.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel approach for feature selection has been presented in order to overcome the challenge of classifying positive and negative risk prediction in the cryptocurrency market, which contains high fluctuation. This approach is based on maximizing information gain with simultaneously minimizing the similarity of selected features to achieve a proper feature set for improving classification accuracy. The proposed method was compared with other feature selection techniques, such as sequential and bidirectional feature selection, univariate feature selection, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. To evaluate the feature selection techniques, several classifiers were employed: XGBoost, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, logistic regression, long short-term memory, and deep neural networks. The features were elicited from the time series of Bitcoin, Binance, and Ethereum cryptocurrencies. The results of applying the selected features to different classifiers indicated that XGBoost and random forest provided better results on the time series datasets. Furthermore, the proposed feature selection method achieved the best results on two (out of three) cryptocurrencies. The accuracy in the best state varied between 55% to 68% for different time series. It is worth mentioning that preprocessed features were used in this research, meaning that raw data (candle data) were used to derive efficient features that can explain the problem and help the classifiers in predicting the labels.",

    "abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a prominent candidate for the Future Internet Architecture (FIA) that addresses existing issues with the host-centric communication model of the current TCP/IP-based Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN architectures that provides a clean-slate approach for Internet communication. NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content, causing different challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this article, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security, and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the community.",

As the availability of pre-built containers increases there is a need for methods capable of efficiently securing large repositories of software containers. We present a “Trustworthy Container Repository” (TCR) system which provides security assurances (confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity) regarding such a repository in a scalable manner. Trust within the TCR architecture is rooted in a low-complexity, tamper-resistant trusted module, which leverages index-ordered Merkle trees (IOMTs) to efficiently track a large number of container images and provide assurances of repository integrity to its users. The key contributions of the study are, identification of the required security model, a novel TCR data-structure, and verifiable algorithms to operate on it. Through experiment, we observe closely logarithmic time complexity of the proposed system up to a high container count (N = 225 ≈ 107).",

    "abstract": "Advances in personalization of digital services are driven by low-cost data collection and processing, in addition to the wide variety of third-party frameworks for authentication, storage, and marketing. New privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, increasingly require organizations to explicitly state their data practices in privacy policies. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released. This can occur a few times a year, when data collection or processing requirements are rapidly changing. Consent evolution raises specific challenges to ensuring GDPR compliance. We propose a formal consent framework to support organizations, data users, and data subjects in their understanding of policy evolution under a consent regime that supports both the retroactive and non-retroactive granting and withdrawal of consent. The contributions include (i) a formal framework to reason about data collection and access under multiple consent granting and revocation scenarios, (ii) a scripting language that implements the consent framework for encoding and executing different scenarios, (iii) five consent evolution use cases that illustrate how organizations would evolve their policies using this framework, and (iv) a scalability evaluation of the reasoning framework. The framework models are used to verify when user consent prevents or detects unauthorized data collection and access. The framework can be integrated into a runtime architecture to monitor policy violations as data practices evolve in real time. The framework was evaluated using the five use cases and a simulation to measure the framework scalability. The simulation results show that the approach is computationally scalable for use in runtime consent monitoring under a standard model of data collection and access and practice and policy evolution.",

A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used. Finally, we propose a roadmap for researchers to fill the gaps found in the literature in ransomware’s battle.",

    "abstract": "Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.",

    "abstract": "The name edge intelligence, also known as Edge AI, is a recent term used in the past few years to refer to the confluence of machine learning, or broadly speaking artificial intelligence, with edge computing. In this article, we revise the concepts regarding edge intelligence, such as cloud, edge, and fog computing, the motivation to use edge intelligence, and compare current approaches and analyze application scenarios. To provide a complete review of this technology, previous frameworks and platforms for edge computing have been discussed in this work to provide the general view of the basis for Edge AI. Similarly, the emerging techniques to deploy deep learning models at the network edge, as well as specialized platforms and frameworks to do so, are review in this article. These devices, techniques, and frameworks are analyzed based on relevant criteria at the network edge, such as latency, energy consumption, and accuracy of the models, to determine the current state of the art as well as current limitations of the proposed technologies. Because of this, it is possible to understand the current possibilities to efficiently deploy state-of-the-art deep learning models at the network edge based on technologies such as artificial intelligence accelerators, tensor processing units, and techniques that include federated learning and gossip training. Finally, the challenges of Edge AI are discussed in the work, as well as the future directions that can be extracted from the evolution of the edge computing and Internet of Things approaches.",

We analyze the case where a trusted third party (TTP) is optimistically available, although we emphasize that the trust put on the TTP is only regarding the fairness, and our protocols preserve the privacy of the exchanged items against the TTP. In the fair SMPC case, we prove that a malicious TTP can only harm fairness, but not security.",

This survey provides a comprehensive survey on data hiding techniques and their new trends for solving new challenges in real-world applications. The notable applications are telemedicine, 3D objects, mobile devices, cloud/distributed computing and data mining environments, chip and hardware protection, cyber physical systems, internet traffic, fusion of watermarking and encryption, joint compression and watermarking, biometric watermarking, watermarking at the physical layer, and many other perspectives. Further, the potential issues that existing approaches of data hiding face are identified.

Currently, such certificate revocation checks (i.e., step (iii) above) are done either via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) servers.

    "abstract": "Nature-inspired optimization is one of the most prevalent research domains with a confounding history that fascinates the research communities. Particle Swarm Optimization is one of the well-known optimizers that belongs to the family of nature-inspired algorithms. It often suffers from premature convergence leading to a local optimum. To address this, several methods were presented using different network topologies of the particles, but either lacked accuracy or were slow. To solve these problems, an improved version of the Directed Weighted Complex Network Particle Swarm Optimization using the Genetic Algorithm (GDWCN-PSO) is presented. This method uses the concept of the Genetic Algorithm after each update to enhance convergence and diversity. Since most of the real-world applications and complex optimization problems involve more than one objective function so to suit this problem, a multiobjective version of GDWCN-PSO is also proposed and validated on standard benchmarks. To demonstrate its applicability in real-world applications, GDWCN-PSO is applied to solve the optimal key-based medical image encryption. It is one of the most challenging problems in health IoTs for protecting sensitive and confidential patient data as well as addressing the major concern of integrity and security of data in today’s advanced digital world.",

    "abstract": "Technology trend analysis uses data relevant to historical performance and extrapolates it to estimate and assess the future potential of technology. Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information.",

This article presents an improved offloading algorithm for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based on Deep Q Network (DQN) and Simulated Annealing (SA) for IoB. Firstly, we analyze the network model and establish a task cost function based on processing delay and energy consumption. Secondly, we define a Distributed Optimization Problem (DOP) to maximize individual utilities and system utility, which is proved to be a potential countermeasure. Thirdly, we conduct Markov modeling for the current offloading strategy-making scheme and define the objectives and constraints of the optimization function. At the same time, the SA is introduced into the DQN Algorithm, which improves the capacity of the algorithm by focusing on the exploration in the early stage and following the experience value in the later stage. From the simulation results, we can see that compared with the traditional scheme, the proposed strategy can maximize the utilization of the system and reduce processing delay and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Many commercially available memory chips are fabricated worldwide in untrusted facilities. Therefore, a counterfeit memory chip can easily enter into the supply chain in different formats. Deploying these counterfeit memory chips into an electronic system can severely affect security and reliability domains because of their substandard quality, poor performance, and shorter lifespan. Therefore, a proper solution is required to identify counterfeit memory chips before deploying them in mission-, safety-, and security-critical systems. However, a single solution to prevent counterfeiting is challenging due to the diversity of counterfeit types, sources, and refinement techniques. Besides, the chips can pass initial testing and still fail while being used in the system. Furthermore, existing solutions focus on detecting a single counterfeit type (e.g., detecting recycled memory chips). This work proposes a framework that detects major counterfeit static random-access memory (SRAM) types by attesting/identifying the origin of the manufacturer. The proposed technique generates a single signature for a manufacturer and does not require any exhaustive registration/authentication process. We validate our proposed technique using 345 SRAM chips produced by major manufacturers. The silicon results show that the test scores (F1 score) of our proposed technique of identifying memory manufacturer and part-number are 93% and 71%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) systems and its applications, the selection of the right crowd is gaining utmost importance. The increasing variability in the context of MCS tasks makes the selection of not only the capable but also the willing workers crucial for a high task completion rate. Most of the existing MCS selection frameworks rely primarily on reputation-based feedback mechanisms to assess the level of commitment of potential workers. Such frameworks select workers having high reputation scores but without any contextual awareness of the workers, at the time of selection, or the task. This may lead to an unfair selection of workers who will not perform the task. Hence, reputation on its own only gives an approximation of workers’ behaviors since it assumes that workers always behave consistently regardless of the situational context. However, following the concept of cross-situational consistency, where people tend to show similar behavior in similar situations and behave differently in disparate ones, this work proposes a novel recruitment system in MCS based on behavioral profiling. The proposed approach uses machine learning to predict the probability of the workers performing a given task, based on their learned behavioral models. Subsequently, a group-based selection mechanism, based on the genetic algorithm, uses these behavioral models in complementation with a reputation-based model to recruit a group of workers that maximizes the quality of recruitment of the tasks. Simulations based on a real-life dataset show that considering human behavior in varying situations improves the quality of recruitment achieved by the tasks and their completion confidence when compared with a benchmark that relies solely on reputation.",

    "abstract": "Many commercially available memory chips are fabricated worldwide in untrusted facilities. Therefore, a counterfeit memory chip can easily enter into the supply chain in different formats. Deploying these counterfeit memory chips into an electronic system can severely affect security and reliability domains because of their substandard quality, poor performance, and shorter lifespan. Therefore, a proper solution is required to identify counterfeit memory chips before deploying them in mission-, safety-, and security-critical systems. However, a single solution to prevent counterfeiting is challenging due to the diversity of counterfeit types, sources, and refinement techniques. Besides, the chips can pass initial testing and still fail while being used in the system. Furthermore, existing solutions focus on detecting a single counterfeit type (e.g., detecting recycled memory chips). This work proposes a framework that detects major counterfeit static random-access memory (SRAM) types by attesting/identifying the origin of the manufacturer. The proposed technique generates a single signature for a manufacturer and does not require any exhaustive registration/authentication process. We validate our proposed technique using 345 SRAM chips produced by major manufacturers. The silicon results show that the test scores (F1 score) of our proposed technique of identifying memory manufacturer and part-number are 93% and 71%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce DIRECTGO, a new MATLAB toolbox for derivative-free global optimization. DIRECTGO collects various deterministic derivative-free DIRECT-type algorithms for box-constrained, generally constrained, and problems with hidden constraints. Each sequential algorithm is implemented in two ways: using static and dynamic data structures for more efficient information storage and organization. Furthermore, parallel schemes are applied to some promising algorithms within DIRECTGO. The toolbox is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring the user-friendly use of all functionalities available in DIRECTGO. Available features are demonstrated in detailed computational studies using a comprehensive DIRECTGOLib v1.0 library of global optimization test problems. Additionally, 11 classical engineering design problems illustrate the potential of DIRECTGO to solve challenging real-world problems. Finally, the appendix gives examples of accompanying MATLAB programs and provides a synopsis of its use on the test problems with box and general constraints.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid development and integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. The market is providing various consumer-oriented smart IoT devices; the mainstream cloud service providers are building their software stacks to support IoT services. With this emerging trend even growing, the security of such smart IoT cloud systems has drawn much research attention in recent years. To better understand the emerging consumer-oriented smart IoT cloud systems for practical engineers and new researchers, this article presents a review of the most recent research efforts on existing, real, already deployed consumer-oriented IoT cloud applications in the past five years using typical case studies. Specifically, we first present a general model for the IoT cloud ecosystem. Then, using the model, we review and summarize recent, representative research works on emerging smart IoT cloud system security using 10 detailed case studies, with the aim that the case studies together provide insights into the insecurity of current emerging IoT cloud systems. We further present a systematic approach to conduct a security analysis for IoT cloud systems. Based on the proposed security analysis approach, we review and suggest potential security risk mitigation methods to protect IoT cloud systems. We also discuss future research challenges for the IoT cloud security area.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy is a very important issue. Especially in fields like medicine, it is paramount to abide by the existing privacy regulations to preserve patients’ anonymity. However, data is required for research and training machine learning models that could help gain insight into complex correlations or personalised treatments that may otherwise stay undiscovered. Those models generally scale with the amount of data available, but the current situation often prohibits building large databases across sites. So it would be beneficial to be able to combine similar or related data from different sites all over the world while still preserving data privacy. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution for this, because it relies on the sharing of machine learning models, instead of the raw data itself. That means private data never leaves the site or device it was collected on. Federated learning is an emerging research area, and many domains have been identified for the application of those methods. This systematic literature review provides an extensive look at the concept of and research into federated learning and its applicability for confidential healthcare datasets.",
