Many blockchains are programmable, supporting smart contracts, which maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the state. Unfortunately, bugs in many smart contracts have been exploited by hackers. Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We integrated a permissions system that encodes a notion of ownership to allow for safe, flexible aliasing. We describe two case studies that evaluate Obsidian\u2019s applicability to the domains of parametric insurance and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian\u2019s type system facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of resources.

This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds\u2014by means of an efficient SMT encoding\u2014basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one.", "authors": [{"Name": "Elvira Albert", "Information": "Complutense University of Madrid, Spain"}, {"Name": "Pablo Gordillo", "Information": "Complutense University of Madrid, Spain"}, {"Name": "Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez-Cerezo", "Information": "Complutense University of Madrid, Spain"}, {"Name": "Albert Rubio", "Information": "Complutense University of Madrid, Spain"}, {"Name": "Maria A Schett", "Information": "University College London, UK"}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "total_usage": "742", "year": "2022"}, {"article_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3539662", "title": "Edge Computing for Cyber-physical Systems: A Systematic Mapping Study Emphasizing Trustworthiness", "doi": "10.1145/3551653", "issn": "2378-962X", "journal_name": "ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems", "date_publication": "July 2022", "abstract": "Edge computing is projected to have profound implications in the coming decades, proposed to provide solutions for applications such as augmented reality, predictive functionalities, and collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

Furthermore, due to the vulnerability of FEL to gradient leakage and label-flipping attacks, the training process of the global model is easily compromised by adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-efficient and privacy-enhanced asynchronous FEL framework for edge computing in IIoT. First, we introduce an asynchronous model update scheme to reduce the computation time that edge nodes wait for global model aggregation. Second, we propose an asynchronous local differential privacy mechanism, which improves communication efficiency and mitigates gradient leakage attacks by adding well-designed noise to the gradients of edge nodes. Third, we design a cloud-side malicious node detection mechanism to detect malicious nodes by testing the local model quality. Such a mechanism can avoid malicious nodes participating in training to mitigate label-flipping attacks.

Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission.

These unknowns are implicit collaborations between functions and subtle differences among similar functions. Current code mining methods can extract syntax and semantic knowledge (known knowledge), but they cannot uncover these unknowns due to a significant gap between the known and the unknown. To address this issue, we formulate knowledge acquisition as a knowledge deduction task and propose an analytic flow that uses the function clone as a bridge to gradually deduce the known knowledge into the problem-solving knowledge that can reveal the unknowns. This flow comprises five methods: clone detection, co-occurrence probability calculation, function usage frequency accumulation, description propagation, and control flow graph annotation.

The communication delay in the IoT system seriously affects the security of the system, while the Merkle proof of traditional blockchain occupies a lot of communication resources. This paper constructs Insertable Vector Commitment (IVC) in the bilinear group and replaces the Merkle tree with IVC to store IoT data in the blockchain. The construct has small-sized proof. It also has the ability to record the number of updates, which can prevent replay-attacks. Experiments show that each block processes 1,000 transactions, the proof size of a single data piece is 30% of the original scheme, and proofs from different shards can be aggregated.

However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.", "authors": [{"Name": "Jiachi Chen", "Information": "Monash University"}, {"Name": "Xin Xia", "Information": "Monash University"}, {"Name": "David Lo", "Information": "Singapore Management University"}, {"Name": "John C.

Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.", "authors": [], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "total_usage": "1,097", "year": "2021"}, {"article_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3414475", "title": "Efficient Distributed Decryption Scheme for IoT Gateway-based Applications", "doi": "10.1145/3441681", "issn": "1533-5399", "journal_name": "ACM Transactions on Internet Technology", "date_publication": "February 2021", "abstract": "With the evolvement of the Internet of things (IoT), privacy and security have become the primary indicators for users to deploy IoT applications. In the gateway-based IoT architecture, gateways aggregate data collected by perception-layer devices and upload message packets to platforms, while platforms automatically push different categories of data to different applications. However, security in processes of data transmission via gateways, storage in platforms, access by applications is the major challenge for user privacy protection. To tackle this challenge, this article presents a secure IoT scheme based on a fine-grained multi-receive signcryption scheme to realize end-to-end secure transmission and data access control. To enhance the security of online application decryption keys, we design a distributed threshold decryption scheme based on secret-sharing. Moreover, from the provable security perspective, we demonstrate that the scheme can achieve the expected IND-CCA security and EUF-CMA security. After the performance analysis, evaluation results show that the computational performance is efficient and linearly subject to the number of messages and the number of receivers.", "authors": [{"Name": "Cong Peng", "Information": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"}, {"Name": "Jianhua Chen", "Information": "School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"}, {"Name": "Pandi Vijayakumar", "Information": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University College of Engineering Tindivanam, Tindivanam, India"}, {"Name": "Neeraj Kumar", "Information": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala, India"}, {"Name": "Debiao He", "Information": "School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"}], "publisher": "Association for Computing Machinery", "total_usage": "316", "year": "2021"}, {"article_link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3587933", "title": "Privacy-preserving Resilient Consensus for Multi-agent Systems in a General Topology Structure", "doi": "10.1145/3582895", "issn": "2471-2566", "journal_name": "ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security", "date_publication": "August 2023", "abstract": "Recent advances of consensus control have made it significant in multi-agent systems such as in distributed machine learning, distributed multi-vehicle cooperative systems.
