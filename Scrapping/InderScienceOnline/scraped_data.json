  "abstract": "Blockchain is a decentralised, trust-free distributed ledger technology that has been applied in various fields such as finance, supply chain, and asset management. However, the network isolation between blockchains has limited their interoperability in asset exchange and business collaboration since it forms blockchain islands. Cross-blockchain is an important technology aiming to realise the interoperability between blockchains, and has become one of the hottest research topics in this area. This paper proposes a multi-hop cross-blockchain transaction model based on an improved hash-locking consulted by the notary and users. It can solve the security problems in the traditional hash-locking, and prevent malicious participants from creating a large number of transactions to block cross-blockchain system. Moreover, a notary multi-signature scheme is designed to solve the problem of lack of trust in the traditional model. A multi-hop cross-blockchain transaction loop is designed based on the loop detection method of directed graphs. The transaction process of key agreement, asset locking, lock releasing and security analysis based on the model is discussed in detail. Experiments of cross-blockchain transactions are carried out in Ethereum private chain, and prove that the proposed model has good applicability.",

  "abstract": "The online social networks have greatly transformed the way that people interact with each other, and have salient impact on our lives. However, there exist common security challenges and limitations in attracting users' activities due to the centralised structure of current online social networks. We exploit the blockchain technology to design a new photo-sharing social network, in which users' social behaviours are stored in the blockchain. Blockchain technology allows the authenticity and credibility of data to be improved and precludes data tampering. To improve efficiency, we design a new blockchain consensus algorithm to support fast and frequent transactions. Moreover, a new incentive model is designed to quantify the contribution of user in a more accurate and trustworthy way, thereafter, reward the user with financial incentives, as well as enable the user to easily control and claim the ownership of every photos they share to the network.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain has been envisioned as the most disruptive technology in the landscape of ecommerce. There has been an array of challenges for e-commerce retailers to handle like transparency, immutability, reliability and disintermediation. The paper is an attempt to understand consumer acceptance towards new technology where the primary focus would be transparency and plans for human salvation by combating the environment and ethical challenges. The study emphasises the prospective use of blockchain technology in ecommerce industry which has been coupled with the vagueness of these issues. Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) has been used as the base model to understand the consumer behaviour towards using blockchain technology as a new platform with special reference to fashion apparel sector. Providing traceability of product with an objective of consumer transparency in this mould will change the way of doing online shopping and will have more onus on retailers.",

  "abstract": "The current study seeks to investigate distinct elements of block chain technology that are now in use in the real world. In this attempt, an opinion poll of real-life blockchain developers was conducted to determine which practices were the best globally. In total, 127 blockchain developers from around the world were contacted, and comprehensive responses were obtained from them. Blockchain technology was discovered to be the most commonly employed in accounting and cryptocurrency transactions, followed by supply chain and logistics. It was also discovered that the most popular or most used blockchain platforms were Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. Suitability for business, security, and scalability emerged as the top three criterion for enterprises when selecting a blockchain platform. Respondents placed 'designing cost', 'coding and testing costs', and 'cost of deployment on cloud platforms' as the top three cost considerations related with the adoption of blockchain technology.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is probably best known as a technology that underpins bitcoin cryptocurrency, taking records (e.g., confirmed financial transactions) and placing them into 'blocks', which are linked to prior blocks - forming a chronological 'chain' of blocks. However, bitcoin blockchain is only one instantiation of blockchain technology and there exist a few qualitative analyses addressing instantiations of blockchain technology. The aim of this study was two-fold: 1) to understand the difference between bitcoin and blockchain; 2) to delineate the need (and role) of governance in blockchain technology. First, fundamental relationships (and differences) between bitcoin and blockchain are presented. Second, drawing on societal blockchain technology concerns, a key element (i.e., governance) and its role in shaping blockchain technology is suggested. This research concludes with possible areas of research (and research questions) that can enable realisation of blockchain governance along the areas philosophical, theoretical, axiological, methodological, axiomatic, method and application dimensions.",

  "abstract": "Blockchains can be either permissioned or permissionless. Existing blockchain consensus algorithms used to create permissioned blockchains to not allow new validators to be dynamically added to the blockchain during runtime. This can be a problem when blockchain is used in swarm robotics, where redundancy is required. Besides, popular algorithms such as proof of work (PoW) that offer redundancy consume a lot of resources, making them unsuitable to run on the powerless robots used in swarm robotics. In addition, such algorithms are also vulnerable to threats such as the 51% attack. This research proposes a novel proof-of-identity (PoI) blockchain consensus algorithm to create a dynamically permissioned blockchain to be used in swarm robotics. This algorithm uses a swarm controller to generate a private-public key pair that is used to authorise validators. Tests carried out showed that the PoI algorithm is immune to the 51% attack threat and can run on low-powered devices such as Raspberry Pi 3. Moreover, the consensus time was also shown to be shorter in comparison to PoW.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is emerging as a powerful technological force that promises to change society's status quo. The UAE has taken a proactive approach to blockchain innovation and development. With the framing of blockchain as a sociotechnical system, blockchain initiatives in the UAE are critically examined in terms of prospects, challenges, and implications for future digital societies. Blockchain developmental trajectories are analysed from a sociotechnical lens, i.e., societal, technological, industrial, and economic trends that characterise the interfaces and interaction among people, organisations, technology, and society, eliciting underlying potential influences of cultural, ethical, and legal rhetoric. Despite strong initiatives, a series of challenges, such as trust, privacy, and transparency, has emerged as blockchain begins to develop its full potential. With these issues, sociotechnical concerns have increased regarding how to respond to the possible consequences that such a policy choice would entail, how to govern blockchains, and how to create a sustainable blockchain ecosystem. The socio-political ramifications of UAE blockchains are critically assessed to establish key features and conceptualise issues to unlock opportunities to guarantee a sociotechnical approach to blockchains.",

  "abstract": "Predicted to be a $3+ trillion industry by 2030, blockchain has still not achieved commercial viability beyond its stupendous success in enabling a multi-trillion cryptocurrency industry. Very high transaction cost and vulnerability to centralisation limits blockchain' s full potential. As cryptocurrency thrives, blockchain struggles to find its rightful place. This paper looks at the public blockchain and its failed attempts at non-crypto use cases to arrive at an accurate diagnosis of what's ailing. Based on a de novo review of the literature, this study formulates and supports a hypothesis on blockchain's economic and social unsustainability. Although economic sustainability trumps environmental sustainability all the time, peer-reviewed literature is mostly silent on its economic sustainability, no one conducts environment damaging activity unless there is economic benefit. So far non-crypto use cases of blockchain have shown little or no economic benefit. Testing our hypothesis may help blockchain researchers define the future generation sustainable decentralised solutions.",

Supply chain managers have started focusing on decision-making based on multiple data sources to correctly foresee uncertainty and develop a proactive and predictable intelligent risk management system. These features make using blockchain and Deep Learning (DL) methods in Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) feasible but are still in the initial stages. This work provides a comprehensive and detailed literature analysis and emphasises that many blockchains and DL methods are used in various stages of medical SCRM. At the same time, by deploying blockchain and DL and combining them with necessary questionnaires, an effective SCRM model can be used to detect major supply chain risks. By outlining the unresolved challenges that must be solved before the large-scale deployment of DL and blockchain applications. Ultimately, research points out the key direction of future research in this field and promotes global supply chain cooperation.",

  "abstract": "Since the development of blockchain technology, many industries are re-engineering business processes. Like all other industries, the supply chain is also trying to adopt blockchain as it reduces the time and cost factor in delivering the products from point of production to point of consumption. The bigger the size of a blockchain, the more time it takes to validate the chain. Reducing blockchain validation time is an open question and many researchers are doing research to address this problem. In this article, we proposed a DAG-based blockchain architecture suitable for supply chain and IoT devices. In the proposed architecture, we made structural changes in the linear blockchain to transform it into a DAG-based blockchain. The proposed DAG-based blockchain takes O(log(n)) time as compared to O(n) in the traditional linear blockchain.",

  "abstract": "The collaborative intrusion detection technique is an effective solution to protect users from various cyber-attacks, among which the large-scale trusted sharing and real-time updating of attack instances are the main challenges. However, the existing collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDS) either can only achieve real-time instance sharing in a centralised setting or implement large-scale instance sharing through blockchain. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based CIDS scheme. Specifically, we present a reputation-based consensus protocol, which incentivises service providers (SP) to evaluate the attack instances collected from collectors and punishes the malicious evaluators. Then, only trusted attack instances will be published on the blockchain to provide large-scale trusted intrusion detection services. Furthermore, we introduce a redactable blockchain technique to achieve dynamic instances update, which enables our scheme to provide a real-time intrusion detection service. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of the proposed scheme through security analysis, theoretical analysis and performance evaluation.",

There is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, risk management, internet of things (IoT) to public and social services. Although a number of studies focus on using the blockchain technology in various application aspects, there is no comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology in both technological and application perspectives. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology. In particular, this paper gives the blockchain taxonomy, introduces typical blockchain consensus algorithms, reviews blockchain applications and discusses technical challenges as well as recent advances in tackling the challenges. Moreover, this paper also points out the future directions in the blockchain technology.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology has emerged as a trend that can influence business, government, and society. By validating the exact time an action is taken without the need for an intermediary, the technology has the potential to provide profound modifications in the public service. This paper proposes an exploratory study built from the perspective of institutional logics whose research question is: how are the institutional logics present in the Brazilian public sector responding to the incorporation of blockchain technology? A qualitative approach was used to understand initial perceptions and to learn about the motivations and mechanisms of government initiatives that employ blockchain technology. Our research has found that, despite its disruptive character, the blockchain has entered the Brazilian public service scenario through an already institutionalised structure consisting of a hybrid logic of different approaches to public administration. Changes in this logic will require greater popularisation and regulation of the technology.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt the existing business models in virtually every sector, including finance, legal, manufacturing, healthcare, government, supply chain, insurance, tourism, agriculture, etc. Because of a myriad of benefits surrounding this technology as such decentralisation, persistency, anonymity, and auditability every business today wants to adopt this technology. Although this technology can be applied to any sector, it is fundamentally considered as accounting technology. It can improve efficiency and significantly change the face of traditional accounting and bookkeeping. The accounting systems of the present are still in their digital infancy in comparison to other industries, largely due to the exceptionally high regulatory requirements concerning the validity and integrity of data and information. In this paper, we will discuss the impact of blockchain technology on the accounting profession, technical, regulatory, and other concerns in detail. We also indicate the directions for the future of blockchain-based accounting.",

  "abstract": "A federated identity is a single identity that enables users to access multiple services across a network of business parties. Such identities are subject to various threats and attacks and face diverse challenges including identity leaks, centralised management, auditing limitations, and long breach investigation processes. This paper proposes a framework aimed at automating and decentralising the generation and auditing of a robust and secured blockchain-based federated identity in a marketplace. Business parties participating in the marketplace form the nodes of a distributed blockchain network and participate in the creation of federated identities. Users of this network can access services provided by any one of the participating parties using a single federated identity. All transactions are fully audited in the blockchain, meaning that participating parties can monitor access to their service and users can trace the use of their identities. The proposed framework has been evaluated using two blockchain technologies (Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric) to measure its performance in public and permissioned blockchain environments.",

The real estate sector's problem is that there are various ways in which high-profile people exploit the authentic user by taking of their land and manipulating the documents. The paper-based documentation linked with real estate is more vulnerable to forgery than digital documents. This paper describes how blockchain is applied to the real-estate sector. The blockchain aims to maintain the history of all real estate transactions and registration in a network using smart contracts. Blockchain allows each property, anywhere, to have a digital address for the ownership and other attributes to maintain all past transactions. Blockchain speeds up the transactions from days/weeks/months to minutes/seconds, which has huge impact on society. This paper describes the solution to ensure the use of blockchain in land records.",

  "abstract": "This study examined how blockchain ventures can maximise wealth through Initial coin offerings (ICOs). Based on the signal theory, this study investigated the effect of the human capital of the founders and the endorsement of third parties on the performance of ICO in the blockchain ventures. For this, this study targets blockchain ventures listed on Binance, the world's no. 1 cryptocurrency exchange. Among these blockchain ventures, 514 companies were selected in order of the largest market capitalisation of their cryptocurrency. This study analysed the whitepaper issued by 514 companies for ICO and built a database by coding the variables necessary for this study. In the results, first, when the founder in a blockchain venture is from a prestigious university, it has a positive impact on ICO performance. Second, if a blockchain-based venture is invested by institutional investors, it has a positive impact on ICO performance.",

  "abstract": "Today, IoT systems have become prominent, especially in the fields of healthcare, agriculture, and manufacturing. IoT systems encompass numerous devices that become targets for attacks and exploitation, thereby making these systems prone to security vulnerabilities. While IoT has become a widespread technology by virtue of its scalability, dependability, and ease of access, its shortcomings should also be addressed. Currently, client-server model of networking is employed in IoT devices which use a single gateway for transferring data and connecting through a cloud server. This model demands a high cost for cloud maintenance and network equipment. Furthermore, a single gateway is not secure as one failed node can compromise the entire network. To improve security, we propose the inclusion of blockchain technology; a distributed ledger where data is stored across several nodes, thereby eliminating single point failure. This project proposes the benefits of blockchain technology in conjunction with security of IoT systems.",

  "abstract": "The purpose is to promote the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology in the design of the modern memorial architecture of a smart city. First, this work perfects the system structure of the traditional intelligent building, and provides a building intelligent management framework based on IoT technology. Next, blockchain technology is used to establish an intelligent building detection system that integrates the lower-level facilities to the upper-level application information. The basic structure and software of each facility, the nodes of the IoT and the underlying intelligent components are further designed. Then, the calculation process of the system is designed, and the system model is tested. Finally, it is concluded through a calculation that MAE, MSE and MRE are 0.0203, 1.7396 and 0.5892, respectively. The model has good performance and can perform accurate tests. Moreover, the comprehensive evaluation shows that the model realises the functions of real-time data refresh, data storage, data display of each module and so on. This work is of great significance in promoting intelligent memorial architecture and smart city construction. It can further enhance the rapid development of memorial architecture in the smart city. Meanwhile, it also has important theoretical and practical significance for smart cities' comprehensive development and improvement.",

  "abstract": "Adopting recommendation mechanisms to process users' data is available on cloud computing to enhance the performance of modelling user preference. Using recommendation APIs available in cloud computing, our work focuses on developing hotel or lodging web applications with a trust-based recommendation service. The recommendation service accompanying trust relationship among users is advanced further to reduce the problem of cold-start users and data-rating sparsity. Additionally, a blockchain service is assisted with an online room-booking service. We suggest that the architecture for hotel or lodging applications is incorporated with a number of requested modules. A prototype is built by the proposed modules over a cluster platform and a blockchain net. The experimental results show that the trust-based recommender of the prototype contains more improved accuracy than general recommenders only with explicit rating data. A smart contract in a blockchain test net for the online room-booking service is implemented, executed, and evaluated.",

This study is based on qualitative-based interviews with three professional bankers in different European banks that are dealing with the challenges of blockchain. The results indicate that blockchain technology is both a threat to and an opportunity for banks, providing support to the argument that blockchain is a disruptive technology that will create new opportunities for banks and new risks to their business. Nonetheless, the current lack of regulation and some technical limitations of the technology mean that blockchain is an opportunity for rather than a risk to banks. Blockchain technology may vastly improve banking processes' efficiency and therefore the products and services banks offer customers, particularly in areas such as lending, payments and capital markets.",

However, there is a need to systematically synthesise and analyse the diverse body of knowledge to understand the influence of blockchain adoption in education institutions at different levels. Thus, this study applies a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to produce a useful taxonomy of the existing research and organise knowledge related to the adoption of blockchain by education institutions. An analysis of 107 relevant studies revealed the prevalence of review works and conceptual frameworks for blockchain applications as well as a lack of empirical research and theoretical foundations to study blockchain adoption. Based on this, future research directions are suggested to enhance both theoretical and practical knowledge of blockchain adoption in education.",

  "abstract": "Recently, after successfully revolutionising financial services, blockchain is now transforming a variety of other domains. However, current working abstraction requires technology to have more maturity from several key perspectives, and linear data processing is one of them. Blockchain, with its core characteristics like immutability, traceability, and decentralisation, has the potential to support various types of data. Currently, we find this design an ideal model to support spatial data structures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is a novel feature. We lead this opportunity to enrich blockchain with efficient spatial keyword data. We introduce spatial keyword index for block (SKIB), which is a cryptographically signed tree, thus maintaining the storage and integrity of original data from its spatial topological contexts. To demonstrate our work, we implement both textual first and spatial first pruning techniques. The comprehensive evaluation shows that SKIB provides efficient spatial keyword data processing on blockchains.",

There are several proposals to improve the performance of the blockchain, however, these proposals bring a series of changes, which are difficult to implement and most of them are not compatible with existing applications. The current limitations prevent blockchain from being used on a large scale for other types of applications or even replace the currently known electronic payment methods, making studies necessary to address these gaps and evolve the technology. This paper presents a literature review of blockchain technology with a focus on architecture, security, and performance, providing an understanding of the main features and exploring the current open gaps, in light of the main tools used in the systematic literature review methodology. A taxonomy is also proposed to support design solutions and helping to classify blockchain systems.",

  "abstract": "The blockchain-based power grid integration business system (PG-IBS) is increasing rapidly. However, due to the limitation of blockchain, these systems have problem of low data retrieval efficiency. To solve this problem, through careful investigation and analysis, an efficient data retrieval method for power grid blockchain (EDRM-PGB) is proposed in the paper. EDRM-PGB rebuilds an efficient retrieval index structure transaction index structure (TIS) for a PG-IBS, while maintaining compatibility with the original system. TIS index structure is built on two data structures blockchain account bloom filter (BABF) and binary tree with transaction information (BTTI). Based on the structure, EDRM-PGB efficient retrieval algorithm is designed. EDRM-PGB's feasibility is verified by the prototype system implementation and performance simulation. Simulation result shows that compared with the traditional retrieval method, EDRM-PGB can greatly improve the data retrieval performance of PG-IBS. Meanwhile, it also has advantage of sharing of index files easily.",

The banking sector is one of the major sectors where blockchain has played a significant role in recording and processing various financial transactions, inter-bank transfers, and digital format agreements through a distributed ledger system. It harms the transactional costs, which influence the financial markets. The global financial system being the most popular sector is prone to many errors and frauds. Blockchain technology can help prevent these problems by enabling a decentralised network that permits all parties to review. The present study attempted to analyse the problems in existing banking financial transactions, understand the importance of transparency and study the usage of blockchain in the banking sector. It suggests a research model for solving financial transaction problems by applying blockchain technology. The study uplifts the security and transparency of blockchain technology throughout the paper.",

The system then links sensor information for every block to blockchain technology. Every block node stores the sensor data for the entire wireless network after the connection of each block is completed. The module also simultaneously supplies a web server. The internet of things (IoT) topology is used to build up this mobile web server. A blockchain is a concatenated transaction record that is cryptographically protected. To preserve the integrity of wireless sensor networks, they need protection against multiple security infractions. Each block of the suggested technique includes the encrypted risk value of the previous block, the current timestamp, and wireless network sensing data. The proposed system, therefore, collects and analyses sensor data to optimise the setup of the wireless sensing network.",

  "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is making significant progress in various fields; software-defined networks with multiple controllers have become popular because they make it easier to manage large networks. But they are open to several attacks, which makes controller topologies inconsistent. To solve this problem, we suggest a multi-controller blockchain for software-defined networking (SDN) network. This security architecture combines blockchain and multi-controller SDN and divides the network into several domains. We put forth a blockchain-based solution. This paper proposed a model blockchain-enabled SDN multi-controller architecture for IoT networks that uses a clustering algorithm and a new routing protocol that is both secure and energy-efficient. Experimental results indicate that the cluster-based routing protocol has a greater capacity, a shorter response time, and a lower overall power requirement than other protocols. It has been shown that our proposed architecture outperforms the classic blockchain.",

  "abstract": "The interest in blockchain technology has grown over the years and its potential was soon perceived for other applications beyond the Bitcoin due to its decentralisation and immutability characteristics. The technology also has some limitations and technical challenges compared to centralised systems, especially in terms of performance and scalability. The current limitations prevent to use blockchain on a large scale for other types of applications, making studies necessary to address these gaps and evolve the technology. Considering this scenario, this paper proposes the L7SP model to work on private blockchain, giving contributions for performance gains, and system management improvement. L7SP provides an intermediate layer of services that allow faster transaction processing and online monitoring. The solution preserves the decentralisation nature of blockchain, so maintaining compatibility with legacy systems. A prototype was implemented to evaluate the model and the results showed performance gains with the L7SP introduction.",

The result is a stand-alone solution that reduces the cost of the KYC process without requiring any central instance to store the customer's data, and in which FIs share the initial costs of the KYC process as well as the running costs of keeping the information about customers up to date.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is around a decade-old technology that initially came with Bitcoin to protect digital monetary transactions with consensus and mining incentives. Later on, blockchain technology is adopted by different domains, including banking, healthcare and governance, to mention a few. The Healthcare industry is massive in a world where data security is indispensable. Since biomedical research documents are content-sensitive with evidence-based research, it is essential to see data integrity and non-repudiation besides other security attributes. Blockchain is the technology found suitable for achieving the desired level of security for biomedical documents. This paper investigates the present state-of-the-art on the application of Blockchain to biomedical databases. Our contribution is to analyse and compare existing methods with a tabulated study. Based on specific investigations, we conclude that biomedical databases are protected through blockchain technology, making those data more reliable and helping to provide effective diagnosis and treatment to the patients in the hospital.",

Machine-to-machine communication and automated action taken in the physical world present opportunities for automation that have never been possible before. However, being still in its infancy, IoT still has many outstanding opportunities for improvement, one of which being security. Blockchain, along with some supporting technologies such as cryptography, enables a decentralised, highly secure and immutable database of transactions. The benefits promised by blockchain would complement the current IoT ecosystem tremendously. In this paper, we delve into the details of blockchain from Nakamoto's original paper on bitcoin and explore opportunities to leverage this technology to empower IoT security. We explore blockchain's applicability as a platform for IoT security in the realm of smart homes, smart cities and in a new decentralised IoT public key infrastructure.",

Apart from safety measures such as social distancing, mask wearing and personal hygiene, technological interventions have also been put forward to mitigate the escalating incidents. One of these technological solutions is the deployment of mobile contact tracing applications, which are software deployed on smartphones and sensors with the capability to detect proximate devices. In this paper, we proposed a mobile contact tracing architecture that is blockchain driven with the main aim of ensuring user's privacy. The proposed system uses uniquely generated IDs and Bluetooth low energy to identify proximate devices that are in close contact. The adoption of blockchain facilitates consensus between the proximate devices so that the system can efficiently keep track of all close contacts. Preliminary test results of the system show high accuracy for the determination of close contacts.",

  "abstract": "Data security is a significant concern for any modern-day network deployment. Blockchain resolves security issues up to a large extent. Blockchains are nowadays widely accepted for secure transactions and network communications. Since there is no limitation on the amount of data being stored, blockchain-based networks tend to become slow as the length of principal blockchain increases. To overcome this issue, the concept of sidechain is introduced. With sidechains, blockchain systems become faster and inherit blockchain characteristics, including security, transparency, and traceability. This paper proposes a solution for creating context-aware sidechains to increase system performance using a heuristic approach. The proposed algorithm assists in creating customised sidechains via optimisation of blockchain mining delay using stochastic modelling. It generates many stochastic sidechain combinations, evaluates them based on mining delay, and selects optimal configuration. The proposed model is evaluated on different network conditions by varying network size and traffic density.",

  "abstract": "The cybersecurity threats in the smart grid network are prominent with conventional approaches providing integrated security control and communication protection for smart grids that are vulnerable to some types of attacks and limit their use in real-time applications. In this study, the statistical function predicts the system performance of the future timestamp and compares it with the actual performance to detect the attack. The asymmetric encryption function is used to find the user authentication, which is complex and increases the network latency. In this paper, a blockchain-based methodology is proposed for cybersecurity threat detection in smart grid networks without increasing the network latency. The proposed model is based on blockchain-based secure user authentication, lightweight data encryption and quantum key distribution multi-constraint-based edge selection, bi-fold intrusion detection system, and optimal user privacy management. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed model is 98%.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain has been adopted in a wide range of application domains to enhance security and privacy. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an important application domain in today's communication systems where incorporation of blockchain is very timely. Recent literature highlights the prospects of blockchain technology in VANET, however, it is imperative to investigate the effectiveness to ensure viability. In this paper, a thorough investigation is conducted to identify the suitability of blockchain for VANET by identifying and answering key research issues. Unlike other existing surveys, challenges related to blockchain integration, evaluation criteria, privacy preservation, cyber security, etc. are also critically analysed. Future research directions such as 6G and large-scale deployment are also identified which need to be addressed by both VANET and blockchain community. Not only VANET, but also vehicular communication systems (VCSs) and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have been considered in this survey.",

  "abstract": "Employment contracts recorded on blockchain have the strength to make it impossible to falsify or modify the agreements between employers and employees. The fact is that the work input through the application remains on the blockchain, and the manager shares it, which is expected to significantly improve the disadvantaged position of part-time workers. As a way to recognise and solve recent problems with employment contracts and wage problems, this paper proposes to store employment contracts in blocks using blockchain technology, enable accurate wage payments using smart contracts, and also store wage information in blocks. In addition, it can be proved by using the contents stored in the block when problems occur later.",

  "abstract": "One of the crucial parts of the internet is the domain name system, which works as a phonebook of the internet. The protocol is designed to be fast, reliable, and not shielded with a security mechanism, DNSSEC which adds authentication later. However, threats utilising DNS such as DoS/DDoS are increasing daily. On the other hand, blockchain-based DNS is secure by design. By reviewing and comparing it with the current DNS and its ecosystem, it is concluded that blockchain currently has challenges that need to be addressed before it can be adapted as a replacement for the existing DNS.",

Blockchain technologies are adopted into HLM; each health record is transferred into a meaningless content composed of serial number and alphabets in order to protect user's privacy. All records are uploaded into personal health blockchain automatically and stored permanently. Owing to decentralised data storage, users have privilege to access their personal blockchain for checking their own health records arbitrarily. HLM is built based on the functions of automatic data collection and alarm system which are achieved by IoT devices in a well wireless network environment, and the blockchain technologies of encryption, hash, peer-to-peer storage forming a personal health blockchain.",

  "abstract": "Crowdfunding is a way for people, businesses, and charities to raise money. It works through individuals or organisations who invest in (or donate to) crowdfunding projects in return for a potential profit or reward. Investing this way can be risky. Security is the main challenging issue in crowdfunding contracts. Using existing literature on crowdfunding and blockchain technology, they put forward a conceptual framework that can provide the solution to the problems related to crowdfunding contracts using blockchain technology. This methodology points out the potential of crowdfunding decentralised applications to lower market inefficiencies by bypassing third parties and easing trades on secondary markets. This platform eliminates the interference of the middlemen. It is highly transparent and secure. A decentralised approach to crowdfunding forfeits all fees for the investor. It also gives a share of the project to the receiver. This model establishes a flexible platform for the fundraiser to start a campaign. The funders invest the amount if they feel the project to be genuine. Once 50% of the funds are received, it will be transferred to the initiator. It establishes a peer-to-peer relationship between the investor and the receiver.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Electronic Governance",
  "abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between transnational non-state actors and sovereignty through the adoption of blockchain technology in governance. Governments have introduced a growing number of blockchain applications to reform state functions and authority mechanisms. Initial expectations for blockchain were to act as a disruptive and transformative force to decentralise state authority; however, this is only part of the real picture. The decentralising tendencies of blockchain technology appear in political spaces where state sovereignty is weakened or absent, particularly among displaced and stateless communities. Conversely, strong states use blockchain technology to upgrade their existing digital infrastructure to empower and reinforce state power. Thus, the diffusion of blockchain in governance leads to the birth of two opposite phenomena: 'eroded sovereignty' and 'algorithmic nation'. This paper presents the data-based illustration of the two-directional diffusion and analyse the motives, pathways and impacts of emerging technologies on the sovereignty-dominated and territory-based international order.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies",
  "abstract": "During the ongoing pandemic, the organisation of clinical trials has proven problematic for many researchers. Recruitment challenges aside, the need to maintain participant safety has made it difficult for researchers to enrol a suitable number of participants. As such, many researchers have had to adopt a virtual approach to conducting clinical trials. Virtual clinical trials have the potential to enable mass enrolment of participants in studies, ultimately 'crowdsourcing' clinical data. However, there remains a need to encourage participation in studies and protect data. To overcome this, an incentivisation system which can be trusted by participants and researchers has been discussed in this paper. Titled Cashish, this system is a blockchain-based incentivisation network that encourages participant recruitment by awarding cryptocurrency that can be used in marketplace transactions. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for trust-based systems and allows researchers to be transparent with participants while participants remain anonymous.",

A review of key policy documents provided existing strategic directions in the sector. Seven experts were interviewed to provide their insights with blockchain in CIS. Using the theory of planned behaviour, expert propositions were developed. The potential of blockchain to protect consumer privacy was explored through questionnaire feedback from diverse credit information providers. By developing and testing a prototype for better CIS, the paper demonstrates a proof of concept on the implication of such a disruptive technology. This is a challenge that has been posed by the World Bank Group, among others. Although blockchain is still new for most applications, CIS systems can exploit this technology.",

To summarise existing research findings and provide a theoretical basis for scholars and practitioners, the authors' team used online databases (WOS, CNKI and CSSCI) to identify a total of 172 papers related to 'blockchain applications in IPP', then selected 82 papers for further analysis based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). As a result, the paper analyses existing research topics and identifies directions that can be further investigated. The authors conclude that the urgent research directions to be explored in the future include blockchain technology architecture, IP laws and regulations, and IP management applications and operations.",

  "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) system is a future standard of wireless networks and will be expected to deploy with the full support of blockchain. Blockchain technology is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to store and refer to the data. In this paper, firstly, we discuss the consensus protocol in 6G and then study the applications of blockchain in 6G. As a result, it has been observed that 27.5% of texts rely on PoW, 22.5% of texts are related to PoS, 17.5% of texts are based on DPOS and PBFT consensus protocol. Blockchain technologies in the state-of-the-art results with 6G, offer various applications such as spectrum management, trusted database, service level agreement, fair access through a smart contract. However, this integration suffers resource utilisation problems, computational loads, delays and bandwidth overhead, leading to a new set of issues that can be solved with the integration of blockchain, IoT and AI with 6G.",

  "abstract": "In the present era of digitalisation, maintaining tamper-resistant records at centralised nodes is becoming more and more difficult. Blockchain technology, which is considered as the backbone of cryptocurrency, is gaining immense popularity due to its decentralised approach to store and verify the data. Blockchain technology gives the freedom to develop a user-specific validation protocol, which helps to maintain tamper-resistant logs of all the activities, known as transactions, performed on a private/public network of blockchain. Because of blockchain components such as data privacy and security, not only the private sector is shifting its interest towards the technology, the public sector and government authorities are also looking forward to this technology. This manuscript targets to propose the use case model of blockchain technology by developing the smart contract and distributive ledger for entity market place. This framework contains all required processes, functions, and services for making a reliable platform for marketing new and old entities.",

  "abstract": "The objective of the paper is to examine auditors' awareness and knowledge of cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology. Furthermore, the study attempts to emphasise the potential changes that might occur in auditing and accounting practices with the usage of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The study applied a qualitative research method and phenomenology research design. Data were collected from eight auditing professionals in Malaysia using semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that the interviewees have a good understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Furthermore, the general consensus from the interviews was that blockchain technology will make auditing and accounting practices much easier and more efficient. Nevertheless, the accounting profession is required to enhance efforts to innovate their field to cope with the latest technological developments. This is one of the earliest studies focusing on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, as well as their implications on accounting and auditing practices. This study is exploratory in nature as there are limited studies on cryptocurrency and blockchain, particularly in the context of a developing country like Malaysia. Therefore, this study could be an initial reference for the extension of future accounting literature on emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies in developing countries.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Information and Computer Security",
  "abstract": "This paper presents how smart contracts and blockchains can potentially be abused to create seemingly unassailable botnets. This involves publishing command and control (C2) logic in the form of smart contracts to the blockchain and then calling the functions of the smart contract for sending and receiving commands and keeping track of the state of bots. We call this technique Botract, derived by merging two words: bot and contract. In addition to describing how hackers can exploit smart contracts for C2, we also explain why it is difficult to disarm Botract, given the distributed nature of the blockchain and the persistent nature of smart contracts deployed on top of them. We then describe the architecture for deploying blockchain-based botnets and implement a proof-of-concept using isolated testnet environments. Our goal is to prove the feasibility of our approach, which we hope will create awareness among the community on the importance of auditing smart contracts on the blockchain and defending against these botnets before they become widespread.",

  "abstract": "The frequent occurrence of product quality and food safety incidents in recent years has greatly lost the trust of consumers. Traceability systems are developed to trace status of products in processes of production, transportation, and sales. However, the tracing data stored in the traceability systems' centralised database can be tampered. In this paper, a blockchain-based authority management framework for traceability systems is proposed. Tracing data are stored on Hyperledger Fabric and interplanetary file system (IPFS) to reduce data storage space and improve data privacy protection on blockchain. In the framework, using the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism, a blockchain-based RBAC model is presented by defining entities, functions, and rules. Additionally, components in four layers are designed in the framework. Strategies of operation flows are presented to achieve authority management in business applications. The framework not only guarantees the integrity of tracing data, but also prevents confidential information from being leaked. Compared with existing approaches, experiments show that the framework performs better in time and storage.",

  "abstract": "As the whole world is moving towards digital payments, ethers and the transaction methods with quick payment features are stored in a blockchain in a distributed network. To adopt pet animals, this technology provides security and flexibility to users. The distributed network is a network system through which data, software and computer programming are spread across on more than one node(computers) and these nodes are dependent on each other. It is nothing but a peer-to-peer network which eliminates a single point of failure. The blockchain is a growing list of records called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. It is a decentralised, distributed and an immutable ledger to store digital transactions. Its databases are managed using a peer-to-peer network where all the nodes in a network are equal and are the major concern in the types of network architecture. The consensus protocol is used for transacting and communicating between the nodes. In this paper, a unique way of adopting pets is proposed where the transaction details are stored in a blockchain whereby using hash value returns further details of the transaction. It provides users more convenient access in adopting pets and provides a better approach to the existing centralised system.",

  "abstract": "Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the trading of digital assets were among the first uses for blockchain technology. However, blockchain has many other advantages as well. This paper details the application of blockchain technology to the problem of domestic safety. In order to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to secure mobile agents in the IoT, this paper will make use of Ethereum and a smart contract. Malicious mobile agents that attempt to infiltrate internet of things (IoT) systems can be identified through blockchain transactions. The blockchain centre is the central repository for all records, guaranteeing their verifiability and making it impossible to forge them. The outcomes of the evaluations show that the proposed security solutions are superior to the ones currently in use. Our research suggests that the proposed blockchain-enabled solution can enhance smart home security while also allowing for more nuanced user input.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain has been gaining significant interest in several domains. However, although this technology is valuable in many cases, blockchain also raises relevant challenges. Data protection is also an increasingly important subject. In particular, after GDPR was published, companies worldwide change the way they process personal data. The objective of this systematic literature review is to examine the usage of blockchain for storing personal data. The review focuses on the advantages and challenges of storing personal data in a blockchain, as well as techniques and technologies for storing personal data using blockchain. We conclude that the main concern is the immutability of blockchain records versus the mandatory change/deletion requirement found in some data protection regulations such as GDPR. However, despite the challenges, blockchain has several advantages for storing personal information.",

  "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) environments are composed of a changing number of devices that produce data events at different rates. The development of blockchain solutions for such environments characterises an emerging trend of applications, thus requiring the system to be scalable. Nowadays, cloud computing technology became a standard solution to provide scalable environments for many types of applications through the cloud elasticity feature. However, when scale-in operations occur, cloud computing platforms operate by deleting virtual machine instances erasing all their data. In the blockchain scope, as each node has the entire transaction history stored, the data is lost, which requires new nodes to download all the history again before becoming operational. Consequently, those operations reflect a significant impact on the system's performance. In this context, this article proposes ChainElastic, a cloud elasticity model to run blockchain IoT applications that maintains the database history transactions from removed nodes. We developed a prototype that runs over the OpenNebula cloud, highlighting the benefits of using elasticity in terms of resource consumption, latency, and execution time. The experiments demonstrate gains of 39.64% in resource consumption with the ChainElastic model when comparing it against a scenario with fixed resources.",

  "abstract": "In 2016, 44.7 million metric tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste) was generated across the globe out of which only 20% was recycled through formal channels. India is the fifth largest generator of e-waste where 95% of e-waste is channelised to unorganised units. There are substantial environment and health risks associated with unsafe e-waste management practices. The study highlights various blockchain-based applications in the waste management domain. The study deals with the development of Ethereum-based smart contract blockchain architectural platform 'e-waste lens' for effective e-waste management in India. The specific novelty of the blockchain architectural framework lies in the real-time tracking and monitoring of e-waste movement by the concerned stakeholders in the e-waste management chain and thereby bringing out the non-compliance of the prevailing regulations for effective e-waste management.",

  "abstract": "Electronic voting machine (EVM), the replacement of the ballot box is the mainstay in the electoral process. Since 2000, in India, EVMs have been used in all elections: four Lok Sabha and 122 state legislative assemblies. In EVM security, duplication of vote and anonymity are important issues to be considered. In this paper, we propose a blockchain solution for securing the voting system, where a blockchain network with multiple nodes and a smart contract for voting mechanism is developed and deployed to store the votes so that they are immutable and cannot be tampered with, making the system highly secure and can be audited by the voters, making the system transparent. A full stack application is designed to allow voters to interact with the smart contract and vote. The unique voting ID being generated for each vote is stored alongside the votes, thus providing anonymity to the voters.",

We focus on the Republic of Moldova, which has been plagued by endemic corruption and persistently high poverty levels since her independence in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The transformative power of Blockchain technology and Bitcoin are then evidenced through a dual analysis of tourism 2.0 (with a real-world case study) and e-governance, which can contribute to increased inward capital investment flows, and help fight off corruption practices. Finally, we conclude that these new technologies constitute a significant step in the right direction, in order to break away from twenty-five years of disappointing socio-economic development performance.",

Its common awareness that blockchain can make financial data security easier. Technology, however, also poses certain difficulties in fulfilling some financial data protection needs. Therefore, this paper recommends a framework founded on blockchain to protect and secure financial data transfer on mobile banking platform. A multi-level authentication was used to secure the mobile banking and a two-factor authentication protocol to generate a time based one-time password (TOTP) for secure funds transfer. The proposed system addresses the requirements of building a secure application for mobile banking because of the increased security and privacy of clients on mobile banking applications. The secured blockchain mobile banking can be employed to enhance the business transaction on mobile banking platform, make the system more effective, and help respond quickly to any transaction on the platform.",

This paper discusses how blockchain can address challenges in transparency, accountability, and trust, especially when dealing with valuable goods like diamonds, gold, liquor, or medical drugs. By utilising its peer-to-peer architecture, blockchain can eliminate intermediaries and reduce costs. When combined with RFID technology, it creates a highly secure and transparent system that can predict and prevent problems before they occur. We propose a supply chain model that incorporates machine learning with RFID technology, which can automate processes and improve system speed while meeting customer demands during peak periods. This paper shows how blockchain is a future-proof solution that can give a significant boost to the current supply chain system. The proposed blockchain-based supply chain model with RFID technology is a promising avenue for supply chain management that provides benefits for years to come.",

  "abstract": "Surveillance is being pervasively used, and its recording is extensively applied in practice. Thereby, protection of surveillance recordings, which is related to multimedia security, increasingly attracts research interests. Traditional techniques, such as watermarking, cryptography and steganography, focus on analysing multimedia content, resulting in high complexity and long latency, which makes them not suitable for protecting real-time surveillance applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-assisted framework to protect the recordings in real-time surveillance applications. In the proposed framework, we design an algorithm that generates frame fingerprints, which involves real-time extraction of packets from surveillance multimedia streams, SHA3-512 functions, and the verification of frame consistency. We use a blockchain for preserving the frame fingerprints generated by our proposed algorithm. Different from existing works that use simulations to show the performance, we develop a real system using a service-oriented blockchain, virtualisation for distributed ledger technology (vDLT), and the effectiveness of this system is demonstrated.",

  "abstract": "The research explores the relationship between the health industry and blockchain to develop a digital strategy that can create value for the healthcare ecosystem. To fulfil the same, interpretive qualitative case studies were used for content analysis where the 'texture of practices' emerged from the data triangulation. The design science research methodology was applied to devise a digital strategy, focusing on problem-centred initiation in the healthcare ecosystem. The results confirmed that considering the transparent and immutable nature of blockchain technology, it could help the health sector develop 'digital trust' and protect patients' privacy. Considering the socio-material view and based on service-dominant logic, blockchain can deliver mutual benefits, thereby resulting in precision medicines, targeted research, and population-level insights into medical treatment. Based on the insights, the study identified the impact of using blockchain as a technological enabler and reflected the value co-creation mechanism driven by a digital strategy.",

  "abstract": "Systems built on top of blockchain are often inefficient. One reason for the inefficiency is that these systems include too many hash operations. To address this problem, we conduct an empirical study on the transaction history of a real-world blockchain-based system (i.e., Ethereum), which contains 300,821 accounts and 14,240,095 transactions. We found that the account usage frequency is highly heterogeneous. Based on this finding, this paper presents hierarchy bucket tree (HBT), an efficient account structure with user transaction behaviour information embedded, to reduce the number of hash operations and thus enhance the efficiency of blockchain-based systems. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the experimental results show that HBT reduces hash operations by nearly 80% compared with the existing account structure.",

Most of the scholars believe that blockchain technology is consistent with sharia requirements. Still, cryptocurrency is considered controversial and declared haram by most of the sharia scholars. Against such a backdrop, the present study tries to achieve two objectives. The first objective of this study is to investigate the technical architecture of blockchain technology and its application in cryptocurrencies. The second objective of the study is to find out the sharia compliance of the cryptocurrency and online tokens like Bitcoin.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology (BT), also known as a disruptive technology, has been recognised publicly in financial applications especially after the introduction of Bitcoins. However, recent studies show that the inherited characteristics of this technology enhance the concepts of supply chain management (SCM), assisting in verifiable and reliable transactional records. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the current state of BT-SCM literature applying in systematic literature review approach. A total of 38 papers have been examined through the analysis, and the results reveal that the field of research is still in its initial stage. In addition, this paper provides the main research directions on the concept from previous studies selected from high impact management journals. Three research directions: BT adoption, BT impact and BT applicability and their key dimensions were identified through content analysis. Therefore, the main contribution of this study is to provide some insights and practical implications for future studies on this context.",

  "abstract": "In the present article, the authors propose a novel hybrid blockchain approach to improve VAT recovery, meeting privacy requirements as introduced by the European General Data Protection Regulation. This will provide real improvement to prevent tax fraud as it will not be possible to hide cash transactions. To limit the amount of energy spent, the idea proposed in this paper is to introduce an authority with a limited action. Moreover, the authors address privacy requirements by providing two cumulative possibilities: (1) separate privacy related and other information; and (2) introduce blockchains pointers to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. Lastly, the paper underlines how government administrations are able to take advantage of the proposed new approach to struggle against illicit transactions.",

Considering the significant number of recently published contributions about the use of blockchain-based solutions in the agri-food sector, in this paper we aim to collect and catalog them. The main purpose is the identification of research trends and possible barriers to the large-scale spreading of this disruptive technology. Through a well-structured four-step research methodology, we systematically review 48 papers. The main result is that blockchain can be used not only to ensure complete food traceability, but also to protect workers' rights, limit the power of supply chain intermediaries and protect market prices, enable reward mechanisms for the development of sustainable initiatives. However, there are still some open issues that limit its large-scale diffusion: lack of shared standards, limited number of real case studies, resistance by stakeholders, restricted scalability.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Mobile Communications",
  "abstract": "The central node of traditional mobile transactions is vulnerable to attack and causes user privacy disclosure. To solve this problem, blockchain and mobile transactions are combined to construct a decentralised mobile trading platform. This paper designs a Byzantine consensus algorithm based on spanning tree and minimal gossip sequence (BCA-TG) ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the transaction information. First, the gossip protocol was introduced to the Byzantine consensus algorithm, requiring the nodes to communicate in the push-pull mode. In this way, every two nodes can sync their information within one cycle. Next, the minimal gossip sequence was constructed by spanning tree, and used as the basis for the communication and consensus-making between the nodes. On this basis, the node views in the network were transformed by the gossip protocol, which further enhances the scalability and fault-tolerance of the algorithm. The research findings provide a good reference for problem-solving in blockchain-based mobile transactions.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology is being employed in a variety of disciplines, including online shopping, industry, medicine, and even government departments. The automated healthcare module is composed of two modules: one that oversees all functions and another that stores data in a central location. Tuberculosis is one of the fastest growing diseases, with an ever-increasing fatality rate all over the world. This research shows how a Blockchain-based system can be used to diagnose tuberculosis disease early using a machine learning algorithm, as well as keep track of patient data for monitoring and medication administration. The system given here can be utilised in the medical community to securely store, process, and communicate patient health data. Seven performance measuring matrices are used to evaluate the model: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC), F1-score, and ROC. Experimental results show that, for these parameters, LR and KNN provide the best results.",

  "abstract": "The arrival of blockchain technology has made a revolution in the field of cybersecurity. Since on the internet, almost every interaction involves some digital identity, therefore the ways needed to protect the digital identity over the internet becomes stronger. In this paper, a blockchain based identity and access management system 'MedSecureChain' has been implemented on a medical ecosystem. An OAuth-based authentication mechanism is used to provide delegated access, so as to protect and provide the control over user data. Further, a document verification system using interplanetary file system (IPFS) and blockchain technology has been proposed. IPFS is used to store the users' data in decentralised manner thus reducing the size of the data. The proposed system provides security and privacy to the identity of the user by using smart contracts. The use of blockchain helps in decentralising the system thus eliminating the control of single authority over the data.",

  "abstract": "Legislation generally requires public agencies to account for their activity to the public. Among the many duties imposed by legislatures around the world are requirements for transparency in procurement of services, budgeting and presentation of accounts. However, agencies in countries with high corruption problems have trouble complying with the legislation, especially in smaller agencies. Moreover, it is typically infeasible for national auditors to audit all the accounts rendered, and instead, they select a small sample for audit based on their level of risk. Another problem is that the presentation of accounts occurs once a year for all agencies, leading to a seasonal demand with significant lag time between auditing and accounting period. In this study, we present a non-technical framework based on the emerging technology of blockchain that could be a solution to all these concerns. We apply it within the context of Brazilian legislation and the Federal Court of Accounts of Brazil (TCU), although the proposal is applicable across a wide range of countries facing severe corruption.",

  "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) technology is progressing by leaps and bounds in the past decade, which opens up many innovative applications that enhance our daily life. One of the notable examples is the introduction of IoT-based smart home services (SHS), which aims to provide ubiquitous sensing and intelligent control at home. Security is an important issue in SHS that needs to be resolved before it can receive wide adoption. In this paper, we propose BC-SHS, a consortium blockchain to protect the IoT-based SHS. The SHS within a community forms a consortium blockchain, while the cloud service provider (CSP) joins the consortium blockchain to provide services through smart contracts. External communication (between smart homes and cloud servers) goes through this consortium blockchain, which ensures integrity, authenticity, auditability and privacy preservation of SHSs. In addition to this, we analyse state of the art post-quantum signature schemes and propose to adopt pqNTRUsign as a replacement to the existing ECDSA signature scheme. This can help to protect the proposed BC-SHS from potential quantum computer attack in future. We provide analysis on the proposed BC-SHS in terms of security, deployment cost and communication overhead.",

  "abstract": "Voting has always been an important part of a democratic election since it allows the citizens to voice their opinions on whom they want to lead them. A major problem with traditional voting systems is that the citizens find it difficult to trust the electoral processes. To address the problem of traditional voting, many researchers have proposed an e-voting system. But it also has its major flaws since it is mostly available on centralised servers and can be hacked. This paper designs a working proof of concept decentralised e-voting system using block-chain systems. The blockchain system allows us to design a decentralised voting system that requires the consensus of many participants and so becomes inherently difficult to manipulate or hack. We also evaluate this system and show that not only is it secure, but it also protects the voter's identity by providing an anonymous voting environment.",

  "abstract": "Today the need for technology in various aspects of life has risen abruptly, hence leading to the expansion of the internet of things (IoT), but when it comes to IoT data, there is a myriad of issues regarding controlling and auditing it. A lack of measures taken for security can also make IoT vulnerable to a number of threats. To better maintain and minimise these threats, using blockchain can play a significant role by auditing and recording all actions that occur while collecting the data and storing the same in the cloud. Due to the nature of consensus methods in a blockchain system, we introduced the uses of the interplanetary file system wherein the data collected will be stored in them and a hash value will be retrieved which will be sent to the blockchain and recorded. In this paper, we introduced better blockchain-based design for IoT which can show the distributed control of how IoT data is collected, recorded for auditing and stored. Through this system we succeeded in achieving secure sharing of IoT data and proper utilisation of cloud storage resources.",

Researchers have developed a variety of protocols and security models to provide security – encryption models, hashing models, blockchain systems, secret sharing systems, etc. All these systems have their own nuances, advantages and limitations, making it challenging for system designers to choose the best security model. Delay-sensitive security systems, for example, should be able to secure data at high speeds with minimal complexity, however, this trait may jeopardise the system's security. In blockchain technology, secret sharing approaches improve the security performance of the systems. This review compares different blockchain and secret sharing techniques in terms of security, QoS performance, and computational complexity. These techniques pave the way for future security systems and can be combined for better QoS and security performance.",

This paper develops a blockchain system using Raspberry Pi, in which the transaction data is created from the sensors and database data. Three different blockchains are developed for customers, warehouses, and farmers. Customer blockchain is public and anyone can participate in this. Other blockchains are private and require registration for participation. Our experimental results based on sensors and blockchain data show that our proposed scheme improves 96.83% of the existing scheme's time.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain, the foundation of Ethereum, has received greater attention on recent years as a decentralised and distributed public ledger technology that offers different properties like security, privacy, scalability and immutability during online data transactions, reduces cost of transactions, and enables verification and efficient exchange of personnel information across many computers without any trusted parties. The goal of this survey is to propel some methods in preserving user privacy during data transactions using Ethereum smart contract. We analysed the privacy challenges in blockchain and figured out the existing cryptographic mechanisms in preserving the transaction privacy. We also addressed some technique for simplifying claim settlement process in healthcare insurance. By using Ethereum blockchain via smart contract, current challenges in insurance such as being time-consuming, can be avoided thereby preventing insurance frauds and thus improving transparency to all members in-network. It also helps to avoid paper-based contracts, which are prone to errors, and removes the intermediaries. Furthermore, there is still a need to examine and consider future research in order to overcome privacy attacks when using blockchain.",

Firstly, the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the privacy data in social network, so as to improve the operability of data and shorten the encryption time. Based on the clustering results, combined with the blockchain structure, the elliptic curve encryption algorithm in the blockchain is used to realise the fast encryption of social network privacy data. The experimental results show that the encryption efficiency and encryption security of the proposed method are improved effectively, and the maximum encryption security coefficient reaches 0.98.",

  "abstract": "Cryptographic hierarchical access control is widely employed in systems that manage data or resources. To meet scalability and high availability requirements, it is desirable that an access control scheme is decentralised in nature. Proposing a blockchain-based cryptographically decentralised access control scheme for dynamic hierarchies that is consistent with the standard centralised hierarchical access control model is the main focus of this paper. We use blockchain transactions, consensus and validation mechanisms as tools to achieve cryptographic decentralisation of hierarchical access control. Important highlight of the paper is that the proposed decentralised scheme does not compromise on performance and storage requirements of the standard centralised hierarchical key assignment schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme requires symmetric decryption operations for key derivation, is secure under strong key indistinguishability and features efficient dynamic update operations without any trusted third-party. Proposed is the first hierarchical key assignment scheme that features all the aforementioned properties.",

  "abstract": "Remittance is a global service used to transfer money to family and friends. Throughout the world, many companies offer remittance service to families who depend on it for their livelihood. However, the current service of remittance, as provided by remittance companies across the world, assume that the recipient will use the remitted funds for the purpose intended by the sender, such as paying for school fees, medical procedures or groceries. Thus, the current model stops handling the remittance transaction as soon as the beneficiary collects the money. The current service of remittance model does not enforce correct usage of the remittance's funds. This paper proposes a new blockchain and smart contract based remittance trust model that fully considers all the steps, and the stakeholders, necessary to ensure correctness of a remittance transaction: sending the money, acquiring a service, paying a service or refunding the money.",

  "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) permits a vast number of connected to construct deep learning models while keeping their private training data on the device. Rather than uploading the training data and model to the server, FL only sends the local gradients gradually. Hence, FL preserves data privacy by design. FL leverages a decentralised approach where the training data is no longer concentrated. Similarly, blockchain uses the same approach by providing a digital ledger that can cover the flaws in the centralised system. Motivated by the merits of a decentralised approach, we construct a collaborative model of simultaneous distributed learning by employing multiple computing devices over shared memory with blockchain smart contracts as a secure incentive mechanism. The collaborative model preserves a value-driven of distributed learning in enhancing users' privacy. It is supported by blockchain with a secure decentralised incentive technique without having a single point of failure. Furthermore, potential vulnerabilities and plausible defences are also outlined. The experimental results positively recommend that the collaborative model satisfies the design goals.",

UTAUT2 is generic model which can be used to study adoption of technologies. The present study applies this model to study blockchain technology adoption in the supply chain. Data was collected from 360 supply chain practitioners in India. The results of the current study indicate that behavioural intentions for blockchain technology adoption are significantly influenced by performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation and price value considerations. The study proposes some guidelines for adopting blockchain in the supply chain. The present study tries to fill in the gap in the existing literature by listing out the factors that influence blockchain technology adoption in the supply chain.",

As a novel networking approach, a microgrid can integrate distributed energy resources and enable the effective grid connection and utilisation of distributed PV energy. Based on this, a distributed PV microgrid group power trading model is proposed, which is based on blockchain technology and game theory. This provides a new approach to optimise the electricity market of microgrids. The cooperative game model of microgrid groups can effectively solve the interest issues of microgrid users. The simulation results demonstrate that due to the transparent and open nature of blockchain, microgrids can effectively engage in dynamic games, achieve the nearby consumption of distributed PV energy, and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.",

  "abstract": "Swarm robotics integrates robotics with swarm intelligence. Consensus achievement is one of the major behaviours of swarm robotics. Strategies that solve the consensus-achievement problem have been shown to be vulnerable to Byzantine robots. Blockchain-based solutions have been shown to improve Byzantine fault tolerance. However, these solutions suffer from poor performance, excessive resource consumption, and vulnerability to the 51% attack due to the use of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm. This study surveys existing blockchain consensus algorithms and their suitability to swarm robotics. Consequently, a taxonomy is introduced consisting of three categories, namely proof of resource, proof of authority, and Byzantine agreement. The proof-of-resource algorithms are vulnerable to the 51% attack and consume excess resources. Proof of authority algorithms creates permissioned blockchains, which contravenes the principles of swarm robotics. Byzantine agreement algorithms introduce centralisation. Consequently, the need for a new consensus algorithm to be used in swarm robotics is postulated.",

Therefore, it is required to reassess the current models, in which various parties generate, exchange and observe a huge amount of personal data with regard to EPPR. Ethereum blockchain has shown that trusted, auditable transactions are detectible using a decentralised network of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralised framework to manage EPPR using Ethereum blockchain. The framework provides the owner of the EPPR a comprehensive immutable log and accessibility to their educational records across the educational record editors and consumers. Furthermore, it provides a recommender engine to endorse skills and competencies to the education record owners and similar candidates for educational records editors and consumers. The aim of the proposed framework is to enable educational stakeholders to participate in the network as blockchain miners rewarded by pseudonymised data.",

However, the current SJ and academic paper publishing infrastructure is fragmented and dependent on centralised servers compelling researchers to hop from one journal platform to another for familiarity, account registration and subsequent usage. In this work, we advance a secure blockchain-based multi-tenant decentralised framework dubbed JPBlock to facilitate paper submission through publication and discoverability. Leveraging fundamental attributes of blockchain, smart contract and decentralised storage technology, we advance novel capabilities including paper tracking, proof of authorship and voting on reputation of journals while enforcing core security principles on-chain and off-chain. Open access papers are made available on a global scale while non-open access papers are securely encrypted supporting the subscription-like model. Results from our proof-of-concept implementation reveal that the framework is feasible and satisfies fundamental security requirements with journals and authors incurring overall costs of $46.66 and $25.61 respectively.",

  "abstract": "The paradoxical nature of competitors collaborating, known as coopetition, is a phenomenon of increasing importance in a world that is becoming progressively integrated through digitalisation. This paper is among the first to explore the potential opportunities and limitations of blockchain as an enabler of coopetition. The distributed nature and cryptographic capabilities of the blockchain challenges the dichotomous view of coopetition - collaborate or do not collaborate - through its technological flexibility regarding information-accessibility. This paper focuses on the empirical setting of the wind turbine industry, in which a multilateral instance of coopetition is taking place with five turbine manufacturers and 11 first tier suppliers being involved in developing new standards for the industry. Limiting factors for coopetition and blockchain are found to be based in social contexts such as competence- and integrity-based trust, and in legal context with competition laws hindering the extent to which coopetition can occur.",

  "abstract": "This paper set out to explore the challenges posed by blockchain to forensic accountants in the prevention and detection of fraud. Blockchain will create a decentralised environment where transactions and data have no third-party control. This technology is capable of disrupting accounting and audit because it is capable of automating financial records and audit processes. The fraud analysis in a digital environment is complex and the evolution of new technologies or innovations such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and robotics have added to these challenges. The framework for analysis adopted is a qualitative study using the library research methodology. The findings portray that blockchain technology is not 100% flawless, impenetrable to malicious attacks and hacking. The results of the study found that technology will affect the core functions of accountants, but the overall effects on the roles of forensic accountants and auditors are still unknown.",

  "abstract": "The current research is devoted to the problem of the interpretation of the concept of consideration in Contract Law when applied to smart contracts executable on a blockchain. For these types of contracts, there exists a possibility where one of the key elements of a blockchain transaction, namely, gas payment, may, under certain conditions, qualify for the standard of valid consideration. Such a scenario may lead to a case where a gift from one contracting party to the other, executed via a smart contract on a blockchain, meets all the requirements for a contract - a situation that is impossible in Common Law jurisdictions since gifts are not recognised there as contracts precisely due to the 'lack of consideration'. The mentioned conundrum needs to be addressed. The current research describes this problem in detail, invites the audience to a debate and sets the directions for further discussions.",

First, use IoT equipment to collect transaction data, store it in the cluster server in the form of blockchain, build electronic commerce supply chain traceability information base and determine the traceability query scheme. Secondly, the traceability state probability matrix is constructed to obtain the source tag variables. Then, the tracing function is constructed, and the tracing parameters are modified by Baum Welch algorithm. Finally, the Viterbi algorithm is used to obtain the tag matching function, and the recursive method is used to solve the source tracing results. The implementation results show that the tracing time of this method is only 50 s, and the tracing accuracy is as high as 99.8%, indicating that the source tracing effect is good.",

  "abstract": "Flexible power trading is an important capability brought by smart grid to traditional electric distribution networks. Flexible power trading necessitates trust among smart grid entities, security and integrity for the transaction among entities for reliable power trading. In this work, a novel blockchain framework over internet of things enabled smart grid is proposed to facilitate secure and reliable power trading. Towards this aim, a cooperative trust-based reputation score model is proposed to provide reputation score to the entities. The communications between entities involved in power trading are authenticated using a three-party mutual authentication model. The transactions between the entities are integrity verified and secured in a blockchain framework. Use of blockchain provides an immutable storage for transactions and ensures consensus across all the entities involved in power trading, so that no entity can deny the participation in trading.",

  "abstract": "Reputation evaluation system, as the publisher and analyser of evaluation, is an important influencing factor for users and sellers in online business. Traditional reputation evaluation system always requires a third party to achieve the operation of analysis and publishment. However, a third party often exposes the identity of the users, and leaks the information. As far as we know, all existing revocable reputation evaluations are based on the third-party model. In this paper, we present a new reputation evaluation system based on blockchain. Compared with traditional reputation evaluation systems, our system removes the third party, it allows users to modify their own evaluation information. Moreover, the user's privacy also can be protected. The experiment performance demonstrates that the overhead of the system is acceptable, the system is feasible and efficient.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain proves to be an ideal candidate for establishing provenance in supply chains. For ensuring widespread adoption, such frameworks must have low cost-overheads while guaranteeing protection from counterfeiting and must provide end-to-end transparency. A vast majority of existing platforms that attempt to address the lack of provenance knowledge do so by relying on centralised architectures or through the use of high requirement hardware components. In this paper, we propose a robust and adaptable provenance framework running on the decentralised blockchain architecture, along with P2P based offline verification, to address the most common supply chain attacks. Minimal assumptions have been made about the hardware required for enforcing such a platform in general supply chains. The proposed system also allows fully off-chain verification of product attributes and semi-online verification of product ownership using cryptographic methods. This allows a decentralised and cryptographically secure flow of provenance knowledge in supply chains.",

  "abstract": "Bitcoin is a pseudonymous, decentralised cryptocurrency that has become one of the most widely utilised digital assets to date. Because of its uncontrolled nature and Bitcoin users' inherent anonymity, it has seen a significant surge in its use for illegal operations. This necessitates the use of unique methods for categorising the addresses of Bitcoin users. This research classifies and predicts the portion of users' activities that are lawful and unlawful on the Bitcoin blockchain. The dataset contains almost 27 billion samples that are divided into nine user acts, five of which were unlawful. To predict cross-validation (CV) accuracy, ensemble learning algorithms are trained and tested. With cross-validation accuracy of 68.63% and 49.64%, respectively, gradient boosting emerged as the best ensemble learning algorithm for classification and prediction, while bagging emerged as the worst. To get the best classification and prediction, hyperparameter tuning is used to find the optimal parameters, which helped to enhance the cross-validation accuracy of the bagging algorithm to 67.70%, with moderate improvements in the rest of the learning algorithms.",

  "abstract": "In order to overcome the problems of low encryption accuracy, long encryption time and poor encryption effect in traditional methods, a dynamic encryption method of personal privacy information in social networks based on blockchain technology is proposed. In this paper, cryptography encryption method is used to obtain the personal privacy information of social network, according to homomorphic encryption to obtain the privacy information plaintext to be encrypted. Then hash function model is constructed, and the hash value is stored in the blockchain to obtain the personal privacy protection information key. Finally, the personal privacy information record blockchain is read, and the blind attribute encryption of personal privacy information is realised. The results show that when the amount of information is 500 GB, the data recall rate is up to 99%, the encryption accuracy is up to 99.9%, and the average information entropy is 8.9242, indicating that the proposed method can improve the privacy information encryption effect.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning is an extremely centralised platform and foments a skewed dynamic in which only a few people can utilise the enormous opportunities it provides. There is an absolute necessity to build a decentralised platform where the users may exchange the trained models and datasets to solve machine learning problems collaboratively. In this paper, a secure way of exchanging these using a distributed trustless scalable platform through blockchain is proposed, thereby making the entire process seamless instead of relying on the traditional centralised platforms. Further, the performance is improved compared with other platforms by using two approaches such as parallelisation techniques and reducing gas usage. An authentication layer is added to improve the security of the whole system. The proposed design additionally incorporates an incentive mechanism to encourage more individuals to learn machine learning to contribute and hence, drawing them towards collaborative learning.",

Businesses are forced to adopt new technologies regardless of their expertise and capabilities, to outperform their counterparts. This leads to challenges, risks, and errors in various stages of shipping. It is possible to overcome these challenges by securing the shipments head-to-head. To implement this, the present study proposes a blockchain-based seamless end-to-end shipping approach that makes shipping more secured, transparent, reliable, etc. Hyperledger composer based on REST server has been adopted in the study to capture the shipping data of the participants, assets, and transactions. In addition, separate Android applications have been developed for managers and customers for effective order placement, management, and tracking. Validation of the order placement is presented in the study to confirm the reliability of the system. The results indicate that the shipment errors can be precisely determined through the proposed method.",

  "abstract": "Data security is an important issue in IoT technology, which affects the privacy of data. A new lightweight encryption technique called DNA-GA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid-Genetic Algorithm) has been proposed for resource-restricted IoT devices which gives high-level sensing of data security. Thus transmission of data with high security is handled by cryptographic techniques. Blockchain is another method proposed in this research to store data in the form of blocks using a hash function where the respective user alone can decrypt the data with the hash key, so that intruders are not able to hack the original data. Several experiments were conducted with different kinds of sensed data for our proposed method, and the result is compared with the existing method. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing method in handling a large amount of IoT data by reducing encryption and decryption time and provide a high level of security to protect the data.",

Various vaccine trials for the disease are being done by scientists and researchers in different countries. Plasma therapy is one of the treatments, medical professionals are using for treating critical patients. This treatment requires a valid plasma donor who can donate plasma after its recovery from COVID-19. In this paper, a decentralised platform for plasma donation registration and plasma matching has been proposed using blockchain technology to speed up the process of convalescent plasma therapy. It uses smart contract to find appropriate plasma matches for the critical patients to locate the plasma of required blood group. It will help in tracking the donations and the procedures afterward.",

  "abstract": "The Indian voting infrastructure of today currently has a high cost per voter and low voter turnout. Several other countries have tried to tackle these issues by providing a way for voters to vote online, and the most promising and trustworthy solutions come in the form of blockchain-backed voting. But most current blockchain voting systems do not provide a verifiable secret ballot and use computationally expensive Byzantine fault tolerant proof of work algorithms that are often slow at appending new transactions/votes. To address the issues, we propose a performance driven Hyperledger Fabric-based voting framework that can sustain over 200 votes/sec with a reasonable end user latency. This effort introduces a multitude of solutions to the current age dilemma of voting, both offline and online with unique features including cost effective deployments, instantaneous vote counting, cast as intended verifiability and an observable and auditable architecture.",

  "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have exploded in every segment present in today's business industry. They have scope in reinventing old businesses, and they are even developing new opportunities for various brands and franchisors. UAVs are used in the supply chain, maintaining surveillance and serving as mobile hotspots. Although UAVs have potential applications, they bring several societal concerns and challenges that need addressing in public safety, privacy, and cyber security. UAVs are prone to various cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities; they can also be hacked and misused by malicious entities resulting in cyber-crime. The adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to data loss, property, and destruction of life. One can partially detect the attacks like false information dissemination, jamming, grey hole, blackhole, and GPS spoofing by monitoring the UAV behaviour, but it may not resolve privacy issues. This paper presents secure communication between UAVs using blockchain technology. Our approach involves building smart contracts and making a secure and reliable UAV ad hoc network. This network will be resilient to various network attacks and is secure against malicious intrusions.",

The electronic signature, based on public key cryptography, has strengthened the trust towards this transformation. With the recent appearance of the electronic seal, this digital transformation is complete. The new European Union regulation for electronic identification, authentication and trust services (eIDAS) has repealed the old directive and provides a regulatory environment. In the meantime, a novel technology based on cryptography rose as an alternative to fulfil these objectives - the blockchain. This paper, analyses the properties of the electronic seal, based on eIDAS regulation, with and without blockchain technology. The developed application uses local X.509 digital certificates and the multichain platform for the creation and deployment of private blockchains. At the end of the paper, an overview of this comparison is provided, using different documents, pointing out the pros and cons of each technology.",

  "abstract": "In the expeditiously advancing technological world, with the advent of IoT and big data, every day new people and devices which store highly sensitive personal data are getting connected. For instance, your Google home is listening to you and collecting data, your Facebook knows a lot about you; Amazon's Alexa gets to know our everyday wants. This implies that our data is used to spy on us for advertising purposes, hence these siren servers make the overall profit off us. This paper throws light on developing a dApp (decentralised application) that could be used in a voting system. Everything around us is digitising which does not mean we are moving towards a safe and secured scheme, thus the revolutionary Blockchain technology is used to deploy an e-voting system (Giorgino, 2018) and this is done using the Ethereum Blockchain (Wang et al., 2018).",

  "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT), it can be foreseen that IoT services will be influencing several use-cases. IoT brings along the security and privacy issues that may hinder its wide scale adoption. The scenarios in IoT applications are quite dynamic as compared to the traditional internet. It is vital that only authenticated and authorised users get access to the services provided. Hence, there is a need for a novel authentication and access control technique that is compatible and practically applicable in diverse IoT scenarios to provide adequate security to devices and data communicated. This article aims to highlight the potential of blockchain for enhanced and secured authentication and access control in IoT. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology, which tends to eliminate the limitations of intermediaries for authentication and access control. As compared to existing systems, it has advantages of decentralisation, secured authentication, authorisation, adaptability, and scalability.",

  "abstract": "Building an electronic voting system is a prime requirement of a government election system to avoid the manipulation in the voting machines and make them more secure and efficient. There is a need of cost-efficient, time-saving, and trusted voting system. Blockchain technology is a revolutionary method that provides decentralised, distributed, and immutable ledgers features. The proposed work utilised this recent technology along with smart contract and keccak256 encryption algorithm to implement vote casting. The performance of the system is measured based on the execution time of the smart contract, average voting time per user, and the hidden and visible gas cost for smart contract deployment for voting. The results obtained come to be promising with an average execution time of 6ms per vote and the percentage of visible cost out of voting and contract deployment is 15.42% and hidden costs out of voting and contract deployment is 84.58%.",

  "abstract": "In the recent past security for vote casting system plays a vital role in the autonomous constitutional authority of election. A democratic country like India highly depends on the fail proof voting system to elect the government. The many security systems have evolved to ensure the electronic voting system to avoid malpractice during election. This paper describes an electoral system for the Indian election on blockchain technology and Aadhaar verification. The proposed system provides optimal security for the voting system and preserves votes stored in the electronic voting machine (EVM). The technology behind blockchain and Aadhaar verification are used to simplify the process of the voting system. The Aadhaar number has to be fetched and verified with the database after entering every vote on the machine. The information has to be verified for the vote of an individual to be accepted by EVM and stored in block chain ledger. All the confidential information is recorded in cloud using Internet of Things (IoT) thus providing cyber security from all vulnerability. The experimental results has proved that the proposed system is efficient and accuracy for providing security for voting system.",

The article explores the barriers in a buyer's adoption of bitcoin based on blockchain technology and discusses factors that drive and inhibit their adoption. Our result concentrates only on the barriers to adoption which includes complexity of the system, absence of regulatory authority, trust deficit and speculation in value. In this article, perceived risk structure was proposed based on perceived risk theory, prospect theory, and perceived value theory. Exploratory factor analysis and six regression machine learning techniques were compared and applied on the captured data to examine the degree and direction of relationship among the latent variables used to test the research model. It was found that perceived financial performance risk, perceived trust risk and perceived government risk have major impacts on the adoption intention of the investor in India and the result clearly indicates that Kernel support vector regression is the best ML technique to predict bitcoin adoption intentions.",

However, being at the centre of the academic debate since the beginning, the unique value proposition levers of blockchain (i.e., durability, transparency, immutability and process integrity) have never been connected to real-world applications on an empirical ground. In addition, how and to what extent do these real-world applications make use of this innovative technology? Our paper, aimed at enriching the conversation about real use case scenarios specific to the supply chain industry, is presented as a multiple case study leveraging a coding strategy that is structured around the reference literature on the topic. In particular, we cover seven companies that are operating blockchain networks in different supply chain and logistics contexts. The paper ultimately addresses the need for both practitioners and researchers to 'connect the dots' between the blockchain networks and their empirical implementation within the supply chain industry.",

Thus, online transactions remained a dream for many. However, the introduction of blockchain and innovative contract technology has boosted their adoption.

The major result is that the nature of manageable risks in Islamic and traditional finance exhibits similarities in many aspects. Nevertheless, the Islamic joint ventures and sales-based modes of finance are facing special type of risks. The most outstanding and unmanageable risk is related to Gharar. The paper emphasised that the traditional risk mitigation tools are unable to manage the special risk in the form of Gharar. Finally, the paper summarises the potential contribution of blockchain technology in mitigating risks in the Islamic mode of finance (especially Gharar risk) and highlights its efficiency. The content of this paper is my own work. This paper has not been submitted for any degree or other purposes, it is valuable in currently strong tension to Islamic fin-tech, and how current modern technology can utilise to Islamic banking and finance industry.",

  "abstract": "Secure client-side deduplication enables cloud server to efficiently save storage space and communication bandwidth without compromising privacy. However, the potential duplicate-faking attack (DFA) may cause data users to lose their outsourced data. Existing solutions can either only detect DFA and fail to avoid data loss, or have high storage costs. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based secure deduplication scheme against DFA in decentralised storage. Specifically, we firstly propose a client-side deduplication protocol, in which the server does not need to store additional metadata to check subsequent uploaders, who only need to encrypt the challenged partial blocks instead of the entire file. Besides, we design a battle mechanism based on smart contract to protect users from losing data. When an uploader detects a DFA, he can apply for a battle with the previous uploader to achieve an effective punishment. Finally, security and performance analysis indicate the practicality of the proposed scheme.",

  "abstract": "As the technology is growing, the value of data is tremendously increasing. Different ways of security threats and hacking techniques are initiated by intruders to obtain the secret data. Image dataset holds huge information. Hence, it's crucial to safeguard the secret image data. In this paper, a blockchain-based strong encryption method combined with stegano to withstand security breaching is proposed. 2D image data segments are scrambled by random permutation and spiral mapped to obtain the cipher blocks. Each cipher blocks are chained by SHA-512 hash and embedded in covering audio signal to enhance protection. LSB encoding is adapted to maximise the correlation coefficient. Standard datasets for secret image and covering audio signal are used and the PSNR, SSIM, Correlation values are compared with existing methods to prove the efficacy of the proposed method. The ideology of applying blockchain technique in cryptography upholds the novelty of our work. Dual level security scheme (DLSS) strengthens the overall performance by sending the cipher blocks embedded within audio signals.",

  "abstract": "The extensive use of vehicles nowadays and the emergency of autonomous driving urge the improvement of traffic safety. Prevalent approaches competent at preventing road accidents are inseparable from the trustworthy data acquisition. But in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), data transmission and storage are unreliable due to constrained resource and unsteady topology. Currently, distribution is widely applied into VANETs for multifold data protection and blockchain becomes preferred with its distributed consensus and ledger for data trust protection. Therefore, we propose a system in this paper, which employs blockchain technology to secure the sharing of visual traffic information. As proposed, the sequence of frames is used for their integrity consensus, the transaction capacity is adjusted according to the frame types, and transcoding frames is defined via smart contracts; thus, traffic information gains more in-depth protection. With the proposed system, vehicles can confidently use the information for safety guidance.",

  "abstract": "Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is one of the promising applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) as the IoT system provides an easy way to collect and monitor the system. One of the critical components to make a city smart is by managing the traffic. The mode of transportation in the city is different, like bike, car, bus, auto, and rickshaw. Most of the vehicles integrated with Information Communication Technology (ICT). As the vehicles share and access the information from the ITS infrastructure, some security issue exists. The security issues are trust management, privacy, data linking, and computational problems. In this paper, the authors first identify the security issue present in the ITS model, then propose a distributed architecture of the ITS system using Blockchain. Then, the Consensus algorithm is used to perform computations in a distributed platform. Ethereum platform used to create a distributed network. The implementation and security analysis are given at the end.",

  "abstract": "The popularity of renewable energy is increasing due to its cost effectiveness. However, not everyone can generate and fulfill their energy demand, so energy trading is necessary. Current solutions are centralised and charged at a high fee for energy trading as they have a monopoly in the market. Energy trading requires the storage, verification, and sharing of data related to the trade while keeping records tamper-proof. Traditional database solutions are centralised and susceptible to data tempering. In our proposed scheme, we aim to solve those problems with the help of blockchain technology by storing data on blockchain and verifying transactions with the PoA consensus algorithm for faster processing. We tested our scheme against the Ethereum network and found that our scheme has a significant improvement in cost and processing. In the future, with the help of machine learning, pricing for each transaction can be optimised.",

  "abstract": "Currently, network function virtualisation (NFV) incorporates cloud computing (CC) and forms a market, providing elastic and cost-efficient chained network services. This paper considers a new NFV market in edge computing, where NFV providers deploy service chains on near-by EC nodes instead of remote data centres. An optimisation problem is formulated to minimise the deployment costs of a required service chain from an NFV provider's perspective, with user service delay guarantees. Due to its NP-hardness, we investigate two special network models, where we can turn to dynamic programming solutions. We propose a pricing mechanism based on bargaining theory to decide fair resource prices for EC nodes. To relinquish the full power of the NFV provider, we design a blockchain-based system to implement our algorithms using smart contract. Simulations are conducted and numerical evaluations are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our solutions and the applicability of our system.",

  "abstract": "Traceability in the agriculture supply chain is required to improve a firm's credibility and the quality of food, fruits and related products. From its growing to reaching the hands of the end consumer, fruit passes through several processes and value additions in the supply chain whose integration is critical. In this paper, researchers present FruitBlock, a blockchain-based traceability application for fruits. An architecture design of traceability is presented with a view of those multi-party transactions needed for traceability systems for fruit farming in the Indian context. The grower instantiates the fruit in the ledger as a fruit asset containing information regarding the current owner and the ownership transfers that happen in the supply chain are stored immutably onto the ledger on a real-time basis which can trace the fruit through the supply chain. Using the application, the researchers have traced apples travelling from grower to consumer.",

  "abstract": "Cloud services became less efficient to health organisations since they deal with sensitive medical data. The digital format leakage of a patient's health information with or without knowledge of the cloud provider may cause serious problems that require special consideration. This raises the question of whether we should trust the provider in the first place or if any other third party may be involved. In this paper, we extend the CP-ABE scheme with a (t, n) secret splitting method alongside with cloud and blockchain technology. To ensure a fine-grained access control, we propose a multi-authorisation scheme where the data user can retrieve the access from the data owner or from a group of certified users when he cannot give access himself. The data user reconstructs the decryption key from only t of n delivered authorisations, and preserves that only target users can read data, which even the members of the multi-authorisation group cannot.",

  "abstract": "With the omnipresence of technology, intelligent transportation system (ITS) is no more a distant dream but has become an achievable reality. One of the fundamental challenges in the implementation of an ITS is the proper management of security and privacy issues, especially how the system confirms the validity of its users. Most of the existing security mechanisms are based on a centralized framework and assume the registration authority and roadside units to be trustful. Therefore, a distributed framework using Blockchain and, a very lightweight and privacy-preserving authentication protocol employing an interactive zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed. An in-depth analysis of the protocol demonstrates that it meets all the security and privacy requisites of an ITS. In addition, the suggested protocol is also validated using the widely used AVISPA tool. The reliability and effectiveness of the protocol are analyzed through simulation using NS2 which proves the practicality of the protocol.",

Mainly IoT environment suffers by various attacks such as rank, Sybil and DDoS because of insufficient security provisions. The proposed BlockTrust-RPL focuses on detecting security threats without increasing energy consumption and congestion. For that, the proposed BlockTrust-RPL consists of three phases: 1) distributed authentication; 2) valid trust-based parent selection; 3) trickle timer optimisation and mobile sink movement. The overall network is connected with blockchain thorough block gateway. Blockchain is constructed with TrustBlock and AuthBlock where, TrustBlock records trust values and Authblock records authentication credentials. The simulation is done by using NS3.26 network simulator, which evaluates the performance of the proposed BlockTrust-RPL in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, attack detection accuracy and average energy consumption with respect to number of nodes and number of malicious nodes.",

  "abstract": "Cloud deployments are prone to vulnerabilities and attacks, mitigated via security patches. However, these patches increase the computational complexity of the deployments, thus reducing their quality-of-service performance. To overcome this limitation and maintain high-security levels, this text proposes the design of the CBSOACH model, which is a novel consortium blockchain-based selective ownership and access control model with vulnerability resistance using a hybrid decision engine. The model introduces header-level pattern analysis, which processes all incoming traffic using a light-weight rule-based method. Header-level pattern analysis is backed by a consortium blockchain model that allows for efficient ownership control with minimum overheads. Due to a combination of header-level pattern analysis with consortium blockchain, the model can maintain traceability, trustability, immutability and distributed computing capabilities. The model can reduce attack probability while maintaining lower delay and high-efficiency ownership transfer. This increases the scalability and usability of the model for large-scale deployments.",

  "abstract": "This exploration conducts innovative research on music education and teaching based on blockchain technology under AI and puts forward the general view of blockchain technology and its potential to contribute to future development. The essence, characteristics and development process of blockchain technology are discussed. Meanwhile, the thinking on the development of 'blockchain + education' is put forward, and the digital platform application of blockchain technology in music education and teaching is given. As the basis of system development, requirement analysis plays a crucial part in the subsequent system design and implementation. Analysing requirements can help people locate software functions more accurately and clearly. This exploration takes blockchain as the underlying technology support and relies on Fabric architecture to explore its application in digital education resource management.",

  "abstract": "Very few studies have been made on the question of normativity relevant to the blockchain technology, initiated with the proposal for the cryptocurrency 'bitcoin' (BTC). The purpose of the current study is to examine the status of norms relevant to blockchain, emphasising the question whether it is about a field of law. In the short period of its existence, blockchain has already enacted an important role, in both aspects of legality and illegality. The current research takes an approach to some cases of criminality being relevant to blockchain and to mainstreaming applications of this technology, by analysing particularly the literature on the matter. The outcome of this paper consists not only in the view that a field of law has emerged, called 'blockchain law', against the generic branch of internet law, but also in the finding that in a parallel way traditional institutions and legal branches are in motion, towards new rights and institutions.",

In this method, ECC and D-H are used as encryption tools of the whole architecture to realise encrypted communication between lot devices. Combined with the blockchain technology, the IOT node access and the IOT dynamic data are stored to promote the dynamic data between IOT nodes to be stored in the offline storage structure, so as to achieve the purpose of secure storage of IOT dynamic data. The experimental results show that the average data storage time is 0.40 s, the maximum root mean square error is 0.06, and the cost is controlled within 34,500 yuan, which can effectively realise the security of IOT nodes.",

  "abstract": "Advances in internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies have led to the emergence of new applications such as in e-health domain bringing convenience for both physicians and patients. However, the development of these new technologies makes users' privacy vulnerable. The threats on private data may arise from service providers themselves voluntarily or by inadvertence. As a result, the data owner would like to ensure that the collected data are securely stored and accessed only by authorised users. In this paper, we propose a novel data-owner centric privacy model in IoT/cloud environment. Our model combines two promising paradigms for data privacy, which are attribute-based encryption (ABE) and blockchain, to strengthen the data-owner privacy protection. We propose a new scheme of ABE that is, in one hand, suitable to resource-constrained devices by externalising the computing capabilities, thanks to fog computing paradigm and, in the other hand, combined with a blockchain-based protocol to overcome a single point of trust and to enhance data-owner access control.",

  "abstract": "With the development of information technology, digital evidence has played a crucial role in court trial. However, digital evidence incurs serious security threats and privacy issues in the process of collection, storage and distribution, and the real scenarios also raise the requirements of openness and transparency in evidence-related operation. To satisfy the above requirements, some existing research works provide transparency, immutability, and public auditability of evidence-related operations. However, they do not give a specific cryptographic schemes, or do not cover the whole evidence management process, or suffer from heavy computational overhead. To address the above issues, in this paper we proposed a blockchain-based and privacy-preserving evidence collection and distribution system that covers the whole evidence management process for digital forensics. This scheme uses certificateless signature and attribute-based encryption schemes to attain the security and privacy-preserving evidence collection and distribution, and provides flexible keyword search and access policy update over the ciphertext. We rigorously conducted security proof and the security analysis. The comparison and experimental results show that the proposed system is practical and efficient in the blockchain-based digital forensics scenario, and is superior to relevant works in performance.",

  "abstract": "In the current identity management process, the problems such as increasing differentiation of digital identities, fragmentation and centralisation of identity information have been exposed. In this paper, a framework, named EverSSDI, using smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain is constructed, which provides a unique identifier to normalise differentiated user identities. A fine-grained authorisation mechanism is designed based on the Hierarchical Deterministic protocol (HD protocol) to solve the fragmentation problem of identity information. Besides, a reliable information verification mechanism is elaborated to enhance the credibility of the digital information. In addition, two novel methods are proposed for identity recovery, one of which is based on Social Networking Services (SNS) authorisation and the other Ethereum Oracles. The final implementation and discussion show that the user has self-sovereign management authority, which enables the user to become the real dominant of his/her identity rather than only a prover of digital identity.",

The increased number of cyber threats over the cloud increases the rate of utilisation of cloud forensics protocols. The lifecycle of cloud computing is getting more affected by the increased number of malicious attacks as more users are sharing, accessing, manipulating, scaling, and reusing data storage. In a cloud forensics environment, it poses a serious issue to provide a confidentiality, integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness platform. This paper overpasses the rift by enabling a novel, secure, and transparent cloud forensics chain-of-custody investigation processes using blockchain. A Hyperledger Sawtooth provides a secure cloud forensics chain-of-custody investigation architecture is proposed. A private block-based ledger network is set up by a group of people who want to exchange and digitally sign on different parts of a forensics investigation. On the other side, chain codes are implemented to automate transactions of a chain of custody.",

  "abstract": "The success of software-defined networking (SDN) technology in the wired environment has accelerated the research on the deployment of SDN in wireless sensor networks (WSN). Since the wireless environment has a shared nature, it is more vulnerable to routing attacks. Most of the existing security protocols cannot be implemented for WSN, as the wireless environment has physical restrictions and the nodes in the network have limited energy, processing capacity, and memory. This paper investigates the possible threats in SDN-enabled WSN and analyses the black hole attack in detail. In the paper, we have also proposed a novel lightweight security model that exploits the blockchain-block approach to be able to protect the flow table in each node, which is the main target of possible routing attacks. We have generated an unchangeable fingerprint called the signature token for the flow entries with a secret key belonging to each node. Thanks to this token, not only have the flow entries been secured against tampering but also data packets have been transmitted securely along the path and secured against replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. The results show that the proposed security model can be a promising solution for securing SDN-enabled WSN structures.",

Most of the existing works in IoT-assisted healthcare application execution do not consider the energy harvesting, computation task allocation, trust access authentication of users, and quality of service (QoS) requirements satisfaction at the same time by investigating different healthcare users, requirements, energy cost, available cloud, and network resources. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes an intelligent energy harvesting, decentralised blockchain-based authentication, and QoS-aware healthcare task coordination scheme for IoT-assisted healthcare applications by taking into account different users, QoS requirements, resources availability, and resource cost. Simulation results on transaction delay, energy consumption, resource cost, throughput, and system reward are presented to show the significance of the proposed scheme over the conventional schemes.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology has evolved to solve the complexity and privacy issues associated with online digital content distribution in the last decade. Several studies have centred on different implementations of blockchain technology, and there is no comprehensive survey of the technology from both a technical and an application viewpoint. To close this gap, we conducted a detailed blockchain technology survey. This paper gives an in-depth look at blockchain technology. It discusses the blockchain fundamentals, taxonomy, characteristics, architecture of blockchain, and accessible consensus mechanisms used in the various blockchain systems. This paper also gives blockchain applications in multiple domains, including finance, medical, banking, etc. In addition, this paper presents an overview of the various problems that currently exist in blockchain technology and future research directions.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology features such as distributed ledger, decentralisation, smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms promise to trust in transactions. It could be beneficial to trust accounting processes. This paper, using theoretical analysis, reviews these features and examines if they could lead to the substitution or complement the role of trust agents such as legal firms, lawyers, accountants or auditors, and even regulatory authorities. The investigation shows that while blockchain presents novel features that are key to enhancing trust, the technology can only complement that trust accounting process, due to the technical skills required. At the same time, the paper discusses the relationship between trust and intermediaries. Future investigations could analyse the relationship between faith and technology, considering practitioners' view.",

  "abstract": "Nowadays, the computerisation and information systems need very fast, easier and secure data analysis models. So, blockchain technology and deep learning concepts play important roles for data security and analysis in field of healthcare applications. Blockchain technology has optimal reliability in various sectors like healthcare, security, information management, smart home, etc. In this paper, blockchain technology is used for the healthcare system to provide a secure and reliable data transmission. Furthermore, IoT-based wearable devices are used to collect the data from the patients. Moreover, deep belief network (DBN) is proposed to classify the obtained data in order to predict the type of disease or problems of the patients. The experimental results shows that the proposed framework and classification model abruptly outperforms when compared with other existing techniques. The efficiency of the proposed framework is analysed based on the performance metrics like throughput and latency. The obtained loss ratio for the proposed model seems very less of 0.0126 when compared with other existing techniques like MLP, SVM, ANN, and CNN. The accuracy obtained for the proposed DBN classifier is above 95% for the increase in the number of patients.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain has become one of the most demanding technologies of the decade. Blockchain is a decentralised digital record of information stored in a form of blocks in a chain of blocks called blockchain. It is totally dependent on the addition of new block in its chain. At a single time, there are a number of blocks ready to be added in the blockchain; choosing one valid block from this number of blocks is a complex and most important part of blockchain architecture. As we know that blockchain is a non-centralised system, it has peer-to-peer network in which blocks are added one by one to the chain of blocks only when a consensus is reached amongst the participants of the network. This paper presents a theory summarising of some consensus algorithm used in public, private and consortium blockchain technology along with pros and cons of each algorithms.",

  "abstract": "Currently, a large amount of information is stored in digital form. There have been many information security problems, leading to the emergence of a large number of pirated digital products. Although there have been many protection measures for digital information copyright, the research content on copyright protection for digital music information is still very little. Aiming at the problems of low data storage security, long confirmation period and vulnerability to attacks in the confirmation system of digital music copyright, combined with Blockchain Technology (BT), a scheme for credible confirmation of digital music copyright is proposed. The experimental results reveal that the DPBFT algorithm can accommodate up to two faulty nodes, which has a higher fault tolerance rate than the traditional PBFT algorithm. The average throughput can reach 1249, which can meet the needs of the music copyright management system and has practical application value.",

Understanding factors that speed or impede disaster recovery is challenging for decision-makers to allocate scarce resources after a disaster. This study proposes a blockchain empowered framework that includes desired outcomes, approach, and the timeline for disaster recovery to improve interaction, collaboration, and resilience. The proposed decentralised framework provides secure transactions, accurate information accessibility, fast communication, and efficient coordination for the involved organisations in recovery operations through blockchain technology. Blockchain technology offers a collaborative sequence of authority and alters a cultural and societal shift by promoting trust and transparency. The proposed framework aims to assist disaster managers and researchers in making more efficient decisions in rehabilitation and reconstruction programs.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain evolved as a core technology of Bitcoin, and earned a significant attraction for entrepreneurs and researchers nowadays. The blockchain is an open, immutable distributed public ledger that allows transactions to take place in a decentralised manner without a need for a trusted third party. Bitcoin, the first successful cryptocurrency, is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system. The thought for Bitcoin started as a means for making a secure currency that had no centralised control. Blockchain application is not only restricted to Bitcoin, but it also ignited the idea of using it for a wide range of fields such as ehealth, governance, arts, culture, education, electricity trading, etc. To apply this technology to many areas, one should have a complete understanding of what it is, this paper is meant to give a quick synopsis of blockchain technology (BT).",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is a novel technology that has attracted supply chain management (SCM) interest. As the literature suggests the positive effect of such technology on SCM, this study aims to provide a systematic understanding of blockchain capabilities for SCM (BCSCM). Focusing on resource-based view (RBV) and composition-based view (CBV) theories, a systematic literature review is performed to map BCSCM, their main supporting resources, and the competitive advantages generated. A framework is proposed to highlight and explain the combined use of RBV and CBV. BCSCM are presented and categorised according to the different competitive advantages they can lead to. The relationship between resources, BCSCM, and competitive advantages is discussed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the literature lacks a systematic review exploring BCSCM from the combined RBV-CBV perspective. Further, the identification, proposition, and linkage between the capabilities, competitive advantages, and resources, as well as a final BCSCM classification, have not previously been addressed in the literature.

Blockchain provides a feasible solution to these requirements. This paper explores the operational and implementation aspects of the business-grade version of the enterprise blockchain technology that benefits all stakeholders in the asset management industry using a theory-driven approach. Implementation technology, procedure, regulation, and social dimensions for practical implementation are discussed. Enterprise Ethereum Alliance's (EEA) Ethereum Architecture Stack describes the architectural framework in the technical implementation. This paper explains how EEA features give the asset management ecosystem a value proposition from a practical implementation perspective. Hence, stakeholders (regulators, asset management companies, registrars) and financial intermediaries get directions on migrating to the blockchain network.",

  "abstract": "Medical records of patients are stored digitally as electronic health record (EHR) for maintaining large data and easy accessibility from anywhere. Medical data is highly confidential and must not be tampered with because it affects the treatment given to patients, and if the data is tampered with, it may lead to the wrong medication. There are some technical challenges and vulnerabilities to storage and access of EHRs in cloud databases. Major challenges include ensuring confidentiality, privacy and integrity while sharing medical records with other users/doctors. Patient does not have complete ownership over their medical records. Even if access control is applied, there are chances of data leak if an adversary gets access to the database in which EHRs are stored. Other than this, a proper history of EHR access and update should be maintained and patient's permission should be required while editing his/her records to ensure that data is not edited by an unauthorised person or by an adversary. In this paper we will discuss some approaches to overcome the above-mentioned challenges and ensure complete control of owner over their medical records.",

Most small and medium-sized foreign trade enterprises rely on the third-party cross-border e-commerce platform to carry out retail export business. The logistics service system has the problems of long time-consuming and high transportation and management costs. The centralised management system makes the cooperation and information sharing between IoT devices under different platforms difficult, and the device privacy data are easily leaked. In order to solve the above problems and improve the level of logistics warehousing management, an intelligent warehousing management system (WMS) has become a hot topic. Blockchain technology is introduced to build an intelligent WMS model based on the existing technical level of warehouse management.",

The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 acts as the underpinning theory and from a comprehensive literature review, five factors have identified to be incorporated in the conceptual framework development. Numerous studies covering the use of a wide range of technologies in the warehouse industry can be found in recent literature. However, it should be noted that, for studies relating to the intentions and application of blockchain technology in the Malaysian warehouse industry, this research would appear to be a pioneering work. Given the countless advantages of blockchain technology adoption, it is crucial that the Malaysian warehouse industry would seriously consider its application as standard business practices.

The central task of this paper is introducing a system that is provably secure for sharing the most sensitive data among the users in a peer-to-peer network. In such systems, the geographical position of the users or the nodes in the network plays a vital role in maintaining the security of the entire network especially for defence purpose. Apart from the existing bounded storage models, the system gives a positive result for 'secure positioning problem'. The designing of the proposed system is based on the network, where the public ledger is maintained by all the nodes independently without any central authority. This zero knowledge protocol proposed in this paper makes the search space size to grow exponentially, which is a major challenge for the intruder to prove their position.",

In order to ensure the security of users' private data, a cloud computing data privacy protection method based on blockchain is proposed. On the basis of clarifying the infrastructure of blockchain structure and cloud computing storage structure, design cloud computing data privacy protection methods. With the support of blockchain technology, based on the analytic hierarchy process model of cloud computing user privacy protection, based on the definition of blockchain messages and IPFS storage parameter settings. Cloud computing data privacy protection is realised through three parts: cloud computing data privacy disclosure path identification, cloud computing data aggregation algorithm using privacy homomorphism technology and data privacy protection algorithm based on blockchain technology. The experimental results show that the proposed method can enhance the application security of cloud computing privacy data, make it free from the risk of disclosure in the storage process and thus realise the privacy protection of cloud computing data.",

Ethereum is used as the development platform to build a blockchain for power interaction management which mainly involves distributed energy transactions. In order to guarantee the rationality of energy transactions in the grid, this article presents a distributed power dispatching strategy using K-means clustering algorithm and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. Finally, the distributed power matching transactions are completed in the power interaction management blockchain with the presence of power operation smart contracts. The experimental results show that the consensus mechanism and power dispatching strategy designed in this paper effectively solve the matching problem in distributed power trading. The application of the power operation smart contract further promotes the success rate of the transaction and effectively reduces its time consumption.",

Blockchain strategies can provide encrypted communication networks for closed wireless transactions due to their multiple advantages, such as transaction speed, confidentiality, better security, increased performance, etc. Since each device in a blockchain depends on the data stored in a successive unit, it ensures secured transactions and resources in the wireless cognitive network. The outcome shows that blockchain helps to enhance wireless network security in different ways. Besides, integrating blockchain into a cognitive wireless communication network will make optimal capital and efficient network monitoring. The numerical findings demonstrate that the proposed CWN-BT model improves the data security level by 98.3%, the data transmission rate of 94.3%, an efficiency ratio of 96.7%, the response time of 95.6% and reduces the latency rate of 20.2%, delay rate of 17.2% compared to other popular models.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger or data structure. Combined with many other technologies, it uses the internet of things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and machine learning. Several industries, especially governments, have employed blockchain technology to overcome a variety of security challenges. Blockchain focuses on double-spending and distributed consensus. However, blockchain networks are inefficient and scalable. Communication overhead occurs due to many replications. This paper proposes an adaptive practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm in permission blockchains. This method divides the node into trust nodes and faulty nodes. The nodes with faulty reputations are excluded from voting. Also, the identified trust node has a high reputation in the consensus process. A majority of voting values select the master node. This adaptive PBFT algorithm is excellent for long-term periodicity and increased scalability, and lower overall communication costs. Finally, the performance of adaptive PBFT is compared to other algorithms.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology could change the way that confidentiality, collaboration and ambiguity are perceived in this digitised world. These features have increased its potential for application in various sectors. However, this technology is still emerging and integrating it with the current system poses several challenges. There are numerous barriers that hinder the successful implementation of blockchain technology in Indian industries. Therefore, in this study a framework based on IF-TOPSIS methodology is developed for analysing various barriers in the implementation of blockchain technology. This work considers 14 such barriers that have been identified through extensive literature review and experts' opinions. Application of the proposed framework showed that 'poor economic behaviour', 'market-based risks' and 'cyber-attack risk' are the most relevant barriers for implementation of the said technology. The study provides an insight to the industries and government to enable proper and successful implementation of the blockchain technology in future industries of India.",

  "abstract": "The vulnerabilities in today's banking system are increasing day by day, where security is the major issue. Today's banking system is totally built on centralised databases. Vulnerabilities can be reduced by rebuilding banking system with blockchain, which is a decentralised distributed ledger which will remove the centralised database architecture and decentralise the data over the blockchain. The transactions in blockchain are verified by each and every node of the chain, so that it will make the transactions faster and secure. This research paper is focused on the vulnerabilities, security and privacy issues and the impact of blockchain technology on Indian banking sector. The data was collected from both primary and secondary sources. Likert scale was employed for designing the questionnaire. Samples of 250 employees from public sector banks were collected. Various factors were identified for the analysis, which employed factor analysis, descriptive statistics, correlation, regression and hypothesis. It was found that adoption of blockchain technology reduces the vulnerabilities in the Indian banking sector.",

  "abstract": "Smart sensors are sensors with data processing functions. They are equipped with microprocessors capable of collecting, processing and exchanging data, and are the product of the integration of sensors and microprocessors. This article aims to study the impact of smart sensors and blockchain technology on sports data fusion, and introduces a hierarchical model of sports athletes corresponding to the motion capture data. A human motion coordination system and reliable construction algorithm based on reliability and probability are proposed. This paper also proposes a data integration algorithm that enables applications in blockchain technology to run at a high speed, which extends the life cycle of network sensors to a certain extent. Blockchain technology is to use blockchain data structure to verify and store data, use distributed node consensus algorithm to generate and update data, use cryptography to ensure the security of data transmission and access, and use smart contracts composed of automated script codes. The experimental results of this article show that through the dynamic analysis algorithm of the smart sensor, it can be obtained that the visual range of the motion data is 22.5, and the network space value is 200. At the same time, it also shows that the use of distributed compressed sensing technology in blockchain technology can reduce the amount of information transmission in some aspects, and improve the speed and accuracy of data fusion.",

  "abstract": "The supply chain is the fastest growing sector of business technology. As it grows day by day, the difficulty of handling vast amount of transaction records thus increases. To effectively manage the supply chain, the participants in the system need to record the price, quantity, location, date, and other pertinent details. In addition to that the asymmetric information transfer in the production process, limitations of the quality monitoring, losses from the counterfeit market and the self-interests of supply chain participants are the major challenges affecting the supply chain management system. Even a small change in the production process can have an enormous smash on the financial growth, trust of the supply chain system. This survey aims to study how blockchain technology helps supply chain networks to overcome these challenges. This survey discusses the current status of blockchain technology and its potential benefits. This survey also discusses various implementations on blockchain-based supply chain networks and how those implementation frameworks solve the challenges in the traditional supply chain system.",

Blockchain technology has emerged later than other technologies, such as internet of things, automated tools, and Industry 4.0. As a digital distribution office, blockchain technology ensures transparency, security, and traceability of all processes performed in supply chain, which facilitates supply chain management. This technology is very effective in reducing the cost and time of activities in the supply chain, which has significant advantages for companies. The aim of present study was to investigate barriers to blockchain technology implementation in supply chain with regard to technical, organisational, and external dimensions. To investigate the barriers, we used the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The fuzzy TOPSIS technique, which is an MCDM approach, is used in ranking variables. To this end, the indicators which are effective in preventing the blockchain technology implementation are collected, and, upon receiving the approval of the specialised academic experts in the field, ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS method.",

The adoption of IT, automation, and technological advancement has shown lethargy in the implementation of new technologies in developing economies. The objective is to examine users' behavioural intention to use blockchain technology for enlightening digital banking services. A conceptual framework for blockchain adoption is developed with the technology acceptance models of a UTAUT by incorporating financial literacy and perceived risk factors. PLS-SEM using SmartPLS 3.0 results show that social influence, financial literacy, and perceived risk have significantly influenced the behavioural intention to use blockchain technology in digital banking services. The social significance of this study recommends that financial institutions and decision-makers must design a blockchain application that facilitates users to accept in the banking sector.",

However, the adoption rate by firms is still low and there is little empirical evidence on the intentions and applicability of blockchain technology, from an African emerging market perspective. The purpose of this article is to gain a deeper understanding of the various antecedents to the intention to adopt blockchain. The study took place in South Africa where a survey was administered to Fin-Tech sector firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Based on hypotheses testing, the results indicate that the antecedent in terms of relative advantage, positively and significantly influences the intention to adopt blockchain technology. This article makes a novel contribution to the emerging knowledge base on blockchain adoption intentions and applicability in an African market context. Implications for management relate to understanding which antecedents influence intentions to blockchain adoption. Lastly, the article now allows researchers to conduct replication studies in comparable country settings.",

  "abstract": "With the increasing number of network systems and users, there are a myriad of data generated by users' daily activities, then comes the big data era. The focus of this paper tries to realise user trust negotiation with the help of blockchain technology. Therefore, in this paper, how to not only detect a malicious user but also negotiate the users' trust value among network systems are discussed. The dominating work is as follows: firstly, a variety of decentralised systems form a federated system. Secondly, every user behaviour profile is anchored on the user behaviour blockchain among the federated system, which concludes the trajectory of a user's overall behaviours, on the basis of user behaviour profile, the trust negotiation model based on practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is proposed. Finally, a scenario based on the model is proposed and its safety problems are analysed, which makes a new try in dynamic negotiation of user trust.",

  "abstract": "In the current era, the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain Technology and Face recognition are the most emergent technologies to make more advanced and smart cities. In our day-to-day life, security and recognition play a significant position, and managing those securities and recognition is vital for the service providers. Major parts of security depend on passwords, encryption, recognition, secure storage, etc. To prevent any criminal of IoT applications or for preventing any unethical activities of IoT applications, there is a need for a strong secure network. Here, we have designed an algorithm to store with time stamping and signature as well as a live location tracking algorithm to enhance the security of the IoT recognition system through decentralised blockchain storage. In the Blockchain server, we have proposed a decentralised solution to find the live location of the recognised criminal face through which we can prevent any wrong activities furthermore. We have stored the recognised information on blockchain storage and used the time stamping, signature, and transaction of blockchain to ensure the security and track the current location of the criminal face with the blockchain. Hence, through storage at the decentralised server criminal information is in the immutable form on the server and ensures the guarantee of data security at an extended level. In the result, the accuracy, real-time criminal location, and the execution time of the output were all assessed using the ORL datasets and self-created datasets. The current live location tracking rate was approximately 99%, while the average accuracy was around 98%. At various sizes and DPI combinations, the elapsed time and execution times were also assessed.",

  "abstract": "In this competitive world, it is hard to get a job. It requires some specific qualifications and experience according to the post. If a person is not fulfilling these required entities, then not able to apply for that post. Therefore, some people, who are not eligible may use different forgery approaches like fake mark sheets, fake experience certificates, fake medical certificates, etc. However, despite being these fake certificates, some people may have a criminal background also. Therefore, large numbers of resources are required to verify the educational records, criminal background, and experience of a person. Therefore, the proposed system provides an efficient solution to these problems using blockchain technology. In the proposed work, we used three different modules like college, organisation, and police. The college is responsible for providing academic qualifications and the organisation is responsible for providing experience while police are responsible for proving and verification of the criminal record. The proposed system is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain platform and effectively can be used by the organisations for verifying the record of their employees.",

In this algorithm, a hybrid integer linear model of network dynamic routing and spectrum allocation is constructed to minimise spectrum consumption and frequency. Based on the extended static heuristic algorithm of blockchain, the link with the largest load is selected to optimise the spectrum allocation, and the linear model and extended static heuristic algorithm are combined to update the frequency gap state of the link where the path is located, so as to achieve the purpose of dynamic routing and spectrum allocation of the network.

Face-to-face interviews and a quantitative survey were used to collect and analyse the opinions of 20 experts in blockchain and food supply management. The results show that contractual parties with asymmetric bargaining power along the food supply chain can implement blockchain-based smart contracts to reduce the negative impacts of UTPs. The creation of templates for such types of contracts and promotion by regulative authorities could help their dissemination. This is the first study to explore the applicability of blockchain-based smart contracts in the food supply chain and its impact on UTPs. We especially focus on the needs of small and medium-sized food producers and farmers who experience negative impacts on their businesses due to existing power asymmetries.",

  "abstract": "The aim of the study is to introduce a new application of machine-learning techniques (text mining, clustering and classification) and the blockchain technology within the intellectual property rights (IPRs) management system. Using such machine-learning techniques facilitates the management process of intellectual properties (IPs) and makes it more efficient. Additionally, using the blockchain technology for IPRs management purposes enables all stakeholders to utilise the extracted data of the IP objects from the blockchain network. In this study, a text-mining technique was used to identify the two types of IP documents based on specific categories, namely, patent and trademark. In order to achieve this objective, a range of machine-learning techniques was used for 5,500 patent documents and 400 trademark documents. The results of the logistic regression model showed a high level of prediction accuracy of document type at the pre-registration stage on the blockchain network. This high level of prediction accuracy demonstrates that using machine-learning and text-mining techniques will facilitate the IPRs management system. This new application of specific machine-learning techniques in the IPRs management process contributes essentially to solving the problem in a conventional IPRs system associated with rights protection and data availability.",

Therefore, project procurement management (PPM) processes are associated with many risks. Hence, APIs are looking for solutions to reduce the probability of risk involved in PPM process. A systematic literature survey (LS) has identified a total 55 risks involved in the PPM process, out of which 14 critical risks were identified by using fuzzy logic with TOPSIS method and results were compared with PROMETHEE method. Blockchain-IoT integrated architecture has been developed to manage the critical risks involved in PPM process and nine strategies are suggested based on architecture. Blockchain-IoT integrated architecture can change PPM process with respect to data (real-time acquisition, storage and accessibility), speed of response and quality of communications, data driven decision-making, and transparent, auditable and trustworthy transactions. Integrated architecture improves the flow of knowledge throughout organisation and reduces person dependent activities.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is a decentralised, replicated, transparent and immutable data store. Blockchains are best described not as 'trustless', but on the basis of distributed trust: trusting everyone in aggregate. Consensus protocols are the heart and soul of the blockchains as they help in achieving this distributed trust. Blockchains are updated via the consensus protocols that guarantee their consistency and integrity over geographically distributed network nodes. Various algorithms can be applied to achieve a consensus based on the requirements like performance, security, scalability, consistency, and failure redundancy. Creating a global fair decentralised consensus protocol is of prime importance, in order to address above-mentioned requirements sufficiently. This paper focuses on analysing the already proposed consensus protocols adopted by popular blockchain platforms to determine their feasibility and efficiency. Parameters that are critical in evaluating blockchain consensus protocol are also discussed. This paper also analyses the hardness of achieving the fair decentralised trust with proof.",

The accounting cost existing in the resource flow is classified. The direct cost is directly included in the business cost, and the indirect cost is allocated in the business cost. Finally, the accounting cost of the resource flow is calculated by the operation cost method. The experimental results show that the safety factor of the proposed method meets the requirements of this field, and the accuracy of the experimental process research method has been stable at more than 80%, and the accounting time of the research method is less than 0.2 s, lower than that of the traditional method.

  "abstract": "Transactions on e-commerce platforms using blockchain technology are required to face high volume of executing transactions and these systems are required to be scalable as well. Most of the networks do not support high volume of transactions. Bitcoin Lightning Network can address this problem as it can execute high volume of transactions and is scalable due to few hops in the network. It is an off-chain payment channel built on top of a blockchain which speeds up the transactions. In this paper, we have discussed various networks based on blockchain and their transaction speeds. Transaction processing of Bitcoin Lightning Network along with the benefits and applications has been elaborated. We also propose a secure model on Bitcoin Lightning Network that can be used for any e-commerce platform or any application in the financial industry.",

For this, we developed a qualitative comparative analysis and collected evidence from ten supply chain specialists regarding their perceptions of blockchain technology in their areas of expertise. Fuzzy set data were coded and loaded into the fsQCA v3.0 software. We also carried out a content analysis of the interviews. Our findings showed that blockchain technology contributes to the generation of relational gains. Blockchain technology impacts the four conditions of the relational view: specific assets, knowledge-sharing routines, complementarity of resources and capabilities, and effective governance. Academically, our findings connect supply chain to the relational view and reveal new perspectives and insights to the operations management studies. Managerially, our findings assist supply chain managers in developing strategies to implement blockchain technology, considering the four conditions highlighted by the relational view.",

  "abstract": "The monitoring and protection of critical infrastructures, especially the ones involving physical assets (e.g., dams, nuclear energy facilities, governmental buildings), constitute a challenging problem. The failure and collapse of these infrastructures can cause untold consequences. Recent works have proposed blockchains as a tool to improve monitoring systems in different critical infrastructures. However, most previous works lack on presenting a more in-depth discussion about how to implement these solutions. In this paper, we develop a practical approach. We propose a comprehensive framework that describes how to implement a blockchain-based system to monitor and protect critical infrastructures. We implement our framework in two distinct blockchain platforms: Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. We compare both implementations and discuss their differences in terms of performance, easiness of development, security, privacy, complexity, and costs. We believe that our results can be valuable for professionals interested in applying blockchain-based solutions to protect critical infrastructures.",

  "abstract": "This paper investigates the major determinants influencing accountants' intentions to utilise blockchain technologies (BCTs) in conducting accounting practices in Kuwait. A variant of the technology acceptance model (TAM) is used to assess the intention to use the technology. A survey based on a sample of 714 accountants and accounting faculty revealed that around 636 have the willingness to adopt BCT in a classroom context. Using hierarchical regression analysis, results reveal that unexpectedly the perceived ease of use does not have the anticipated impact on the intention to use BCT, whereas usefulness, compatibility, subjective norms and attitudes have a direct influence to the intentions to use BCT for academic activities. Findings of the study show that TAM can be customised and used in a non-conventional setting such as BCT. This study is one of the rare attempts to analyse factors influencing accountants' adoption of BCT in a developing economy.",

  "abstract": "Industries applaud blockchain technology because of its nature of removing intermediaries involved in assets and value exchange. The first and second-generation blockchain operates in silos and restricts inter-blockchain communication. This restriction is a hindrance to implement blockchain for the real-world asset and value exchange. So, the third generation blockchains focus on issues like scalability and interoperability. We believe that a solution for interoperability can solve the complexities involved in providing blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS). Hence, we reviewed various projects that aim to build fungible blockchains. Each project uses its protocol stack for achieving interoperability. In this research, we conducted a thorough literature review and identified the strengths and weaknesses of various blockchain interoperable projects. We have classified these projects based on the interoperability scheme and finality consensus. This survey helps the researchers and industries to identify the research gaps and choose the best suitable project for their research and business needs.",

Development aspects of EHR addressed by each were analysed, hence tracing the path taken by each. Researchers for the betterment of traditional EHR sought to address usability, adaptability, needs of specialised areas, and patient inclusivity in the workflow, while stressing the application of EHR for predictive analysis, preventive healthcare, population health, etc. The literature on blockchain-based EHR contributed to mitigating the interoperability, promoting data sharing and patient-centric records.

In this study, we use internet of things (IoT) input-gathering methods to check crop availability. This technology-enabled service inputs weather, moisture, temperature, and soil fertility data and outputs crop availability. Machine learning monitors and predicts crop availability by predicting weed, water, insect, and animal infiltration and crop growth. The paper suggests blockchain-based AI. Energy savings are shown. Decentralized data storage enhances supply chain visibility and quality, boosting farmer participation. Blockchain enhances supply chain security and provenance. Blockchain protects supply chain data transfers. The simulation compares existing approaches and the proposed machine learning-based blockchain. Crop feature extraction and classification are simulated. The proposed ML model is more accurate, exact, and recalled. By 2050, 70% of food will come from agriculture. On a 9-billion-person planet, manufacturers must be more efficient. This newspaper offers IoT and blockchain to tackle these issues.",

  "abstract": "Business intelligence (BI) is a technology-driven process for analysing data and presenting reports, which helps managers and executives to make better business decisions. In order to achieve a proper data analysis and an optimised visualisation, a variety of tools, applications and methodologies can be used. Those analytical results consist of the driving force of business decision-making process that is why the methodologies that are going to be used in each case must be chosen carefully. Systems science provides methodologies suitable for data analysis. So, the main purpose of our study is to present to you how the systems thinking and systemic methodologies like DCSYM, systems dynamics, etc., can be applied on blockchain technologies (BT). Also, through the different sections of this study we will present a stage of a multi-methodology that we are developing for the systemic management of blockchain technologies.",

  "abstract": "The process of the cheque clearance system takes a long time, and trust a third-party intermediator to process them. But blockchain is immutable, forgery can be avoided, and transactions at each end are recorded in blockchain technology to avoid changes, so they remain permanently, which provides security. We have used smart contracts to automate the entire process. This paper proposes an Ethereum-based blockchain framework for cheque generation based on the token concept using smart contracts and processing them with a novel framework architecture replacing traditional processes. The improved model involves digital token using smart contracts, transferring the cheque to the beneficiary, approving the cheque by the bank, and updating the cheque status. The contracts are designed and aimed to be faster, more secure, and more convenient. The results showed that the proposed framework algorithm is linear to time complexity. The response time duration for processing contracts is reduced compared to the existing approach.",

Thus, this paper investigates BCT from a technology management perspective that includes three parts: 1) topic identification; 2) topic evolution analysis; 3) topic prediction. In the first part, the major application fields and annual topics of BCT are identified based on cluster analysis and the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), respectively. The second part calculates the topic importance and similarities amongst annual topics. Five evolutionary patterns were obtained based on the similarity relations. In the last part, both emerging and lasting topics are predicted by considering their importance and evolutionary patterns. The findings are substantial and interesting, including five main BCT-application fields, several emerging and lasting technical topics and the two longest evolutionary paths.",

So, this research developed a useful BC-centred approach for data preservation and secured sharing in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The Data Deduplication (DD) idea is used to utilise memory. The uploaded file's Hash Code (HC) is generated using the Stribog hashing algorithm. DD is tested based on this technique to avoid storing duplicate copies of data. To ensure security, the system uses Modified Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (MCP-ABE) to collect data in an encrypted format in the distributed cloud. The Distributed Cloud Servers (DCS) are chosen using the Weight and Exhaustiveness-based Harris Hawks Optimisation (WEH²O). Finally, the data is safely stored on a BC-based cloud that also provides security. Based on the experimental results, the proposed work performed better than the existing data transmission methods.",

  "abstract": "Sharing of identity information is common and is used to avail different kinds of benefits from the organisations. But this process is becoming trustless and complicated because of the involvement of physical documents or sharing through third-party online service providers. To overcome this, the paper proposes a decentralised way of sharing users' identity information with organisations by using blockchain technology. The information stored in blockchain becomes tamper-less and credible. The identity information of the user is tagged with their public key. So, whenever the user wishes to share identity information, they simply share their public key to the organisation and provide access to them. Also, by making use of smart contracts only required information is shared with the organisation for a limited period. This avoids the leakage of identity information.",

  "abstract": "The new emerging idea of energy router and energy blockchain network (EBN) is gaining remarkable attention due to various applications and innovative solutions for efficient energy trading. However, the implementation of the EBN raises multiple challenges such as lack of power loss consideration and congestion management, insufficient computing, and higher transaction costs. This paper introduces a new energy trading approach to counter energy trading challenges effectively and perform optimal energy trading. The proposed systematic design was divided into four steps which execute (i) forming trading pairs through a two-stage Stackelberg game model, (ii) checking security by using the characteristics of directional power flow, (iii) congestion management through the minimum loss multi-path power transmission scheme, (iv) forming smart contracts, and settling transactions. The performance of the proposed framework is verified using 13 nodes EBN implementation, where the results obtained demonstrate accurate energy trading, balanced trading prices, even in congestion conditions.",

  "abstract": "As products move from production to consumption, an agri-food value chain is a complicated system; it should be traceable to its origin, maintaining customers' health. Farm-to-fork food safety and quality certifications have become mandatory and should follow the Food Safety and Standards Act. But, in reality, this is not happening. Pressure regulates by the end users because of malpractices during harvest, additional toxic chemicals, and illicit trades. Adopting data-driven practices demanded due to malpractices and pressure regulation forces researchers to develop better traceable value chain systems. A blockchain-based solution applicable to agri-foods (securing the real-time exchange of information with centralised structure intermediaries) is proposed. It adheres to standards of safety throughout the supply chain. Considering the perishability, fruits are taken as a domain for validation. The proposed solution makes a significant addition to the existing literature on Indian agri-food, which is substantial in the traceability and safety of agri-food products.",

Indeed, this work presents a comparative approach between the efficient capital market principals and the fundamentals of ICOs based on a documentary and qualitative analysis of the scientific literature and ICOs professional reports concerning the most relevant keywords related to the conceptual framework of market efficiency. As a result, we conclude according to our comparative conceptual model that ICOs market based on smart contract has many similarities with the efficient capital market where the self-regulation is the rule and each investor has free access to relevant information, and then all transactions are executed in such trust and transparency. Moreover, many factors such as regulation and institutional disclosure, liquidity and systemic risk have a significant impact on the market efficiency according to the scientific literature and professional experiences.",

These issues debilitate the performance of the supply chain and often harm the consumer's health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address food quality and safety assurance in the supply chain. Blockchain technology (BCT) holds the potential to resolve these issues by enhancing security and transparency. The present study explores the critical success factors (CSFs) of BCT adoption readiness in the AFSC. Initially, CSFs are identified through a literature survey and finalised by experts' opinion. The finalised factors are prioritised using the fuzzy best-worst method, followed by sensitivity analysis. The results reflect that 'food quality control', 'provenance tracking and traceability', and 'partnership and trust' as the top three success factors. The study's findings will assist policymakers, managers, and practitioners in strategising the decision-making process while BCT dissemination.",

  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has shocked the globe with an enormous number of people infected and a large death toll across several nations. A deadly virus has many victims but no country could stand out when it comes to producing a vaccine. The virus is so dangerous that it spreads rapidly through human contact and a person who is infected will infect around 600 people a month. It is so fast that more than 50,000 people are affected in one day in some countries and more than 1,000 people die in one day. There are many patients but not enough doctors and hospitals to treat them as the infection grows exponentially. No doctor can examine chest X-ray in thousands and have fast turnaround. We want to create a solution to reduce the workload on doctors, to easily determine whether a chest X-ray pneumonia is due to coronavirus or not, so that the rapid spread can be controlled and proper cure could be given to patients. Here we also add the distributed ledger technology called blockchain, which helps in monitoring the patient health data and thus it helps in having the complete history of the patient.",

  "abstract": "Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have the potential to transform different areas of research and industry. Initially created to support a peer-to-peer electronic cash system – more commonly known as bitcoin – blockchains provide a decentralised transactions and data management technology. This decentralised technology is secure, anonymous, and transparent. Nonetheless, the blockchain protocol has a number of technical weaknesses such as power computing dependency and high power consumption. An alternative protocol proposes a democratic approach in which the computing power is not a determinant factor in user participation. The democratic protocol has three phases: hash generation, hash broadcast, and hash validation. We evaluate the performance of the hash generation phase on CPU, GPU, and cluster platforms. A considerable speedup is achieved with GPUs when using final nonce values similar to a real blockchain application. Also, it provides the best power efficiency.",

  "abstract": "The application of electronic information technology in medical treatment has become more and more popular, but there are also many challenging problems, exemplified by data forgery and tampering in data sharing. This paper proposes a blockchain-based attribute-based keyword searchable encryption scheme for health cloud systems, which solves some problems of privacy disclosure and data tampering in data sharing. Firstly, by using attribute-based encryption with keyword search technology, users can share search capabilities in a fine-grained way, and if their attributes are changed, their access permission will be revoked in time. Besides, we introduce blockchain and digital signature technologies to ensure the correctness and integrity of data. We encrypt the access policy to prevent privacy disclosure in the access structure. Finally, security analysis and simulation experiments show that our scheme is secure and effective, and the efficiency of search is improved by approximately 40% compared with ABKS-HD.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering",
  "abstract": "Currently, our global financial market faces lots of trouble due to migration from fiat currency to cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain provides trust in a decentralised way for storing, managing, and retrieving the transactions. The double-spending issue arises due to the erroneous transaction verification mechanism in the blockchain. Research has shown that transaction malleability like double-spending creates millions of bitcoins losses to the owners as well as few bitcoin exchanges. This research aims to detect and prevent the double-spending of bitcoins in single and multiple blocks. In this context, double-spend data in a single block is identified using the DPL2A method. Further, the original transaction from the double-spend transaction list is identified using the ACRT method which acts as a prevention of double-spend in a forthcoming occurrence. Similarly, double-spend data in multiple blocks are identified using MBDTD along with the Cognizant Merkle tree. Finally, a system named F2DP is constructed to detect and prevent the double-spend data in inter and intra blocks of the blockchain. The result indicates these methods will act best for double-spend detection and prevention with a limited set of transaction records. Further research is needed to increase the scalability of transaction records.",

  "abstract": "Establishing a credible food traceability system is an effective way to solve food safety problems. While most existing blockchain-based traceability systems are not convincing because the traceability information stored on the chain is just coming from one single organisation. Without the upstream and downstream trading information of the supply chain, even blockchain-based systems with immutability and transparent credibility advantages cannot guarantee accurate traceability for customers. We establish a food supply chain traceability system called FSCTS which aggregates all the enterprises and organisations along the food supply chain to make deals and transactions on the blockchain. Through analysing the trading data associating the whole food circulation from production to consumption, reliable transaction-based traceability can be achieved to provide trusted food tracing. We implement the system on the base of Hyperledger Fabric and prove the effectiveness and superiority of FSCTS by conducting extensive comparison experiments with some similar traceability systems.",

The focus on this paper is two-fold. The first contribution is to review the existing literature critically and systematically on blockchain use in the pharmaceutical sector. We identify four crucial factors that are critical in the pharmaceutical sector. Subsequently, we systematically review the existing literature on blockchain use in the pharmaceutical sector. The second contribution is based on the analysis of the existing literature, we identify key research gaps on blockchain use in the pharmaceutical sector.

The best practice for estimating a prediction of the system dynamics relies on benchmarking. Each novel middleware solution needs such an evaluation as part of the development process to assure an appropriate throughput in the future use. General purpose blockchain frameworks are viable replacements for many current systems in several sectors by providing a fully distributed, secure, and non-repudiable ledger as a service. Blockchain technologies target domains with a large number of interactions, thus demanding strict performance guarantees. Engineering for performance targets in a trustworthy manner requires performance models. However, performance characteristics of blockchain systems are highly unexplored due to the novelty of the technology. This paper proposes a general-purpose, systematic methodology for the performance analysis of complex systems, aided by a component-in-the-loop approach. The Linux foundation-hosted hyperledger fabric serves as a case study for the presented methodology.",

This paper explores the key issues related to data security and cryptographic currencies and block chaining, and reassesses the emergence of the digital central bank currency and the arguments against issuing digital central bank money. This paper also starts from the premise that digital currency can be the vice that spreads the fervour of the euro in inter-cultural transactions and that there is a direct relationship between a nation's currency and culture and its image. The questions for assessing the adequacy of the market infrastructure and the digitalised currencies extend the premonition of arguments about the weaknesses of the euro Central Bank Digital Currencies in an effort to develop a context-specific model for the euro zone.",

  "abstract": "The intelligent logistics ecological chain (ILEC) imposes strict requirements on the selection of logistics service providers (LSPs), while the trust behaviour and information asymmetry are two key factors need to be considered. We consider the vertical quality difference of LSP in ILEC and information asymmetry and build the Stacklberg games, to find the conditions for the occurrence of conflicts caused by quality fraud. Then we propose blockchain mechanism to resolve this conflict. We derive important conclusions and contributions. First, when logistics platform integrator (LPI) has low (high) trust in LSP, LSP always chooses to be honest (mimic). Second, there is a win-win situation between LPI and high-quality LSP, while a zero-sum game between LPI and low-quality LSP. Finally, when cooperating with low-quality LSP in low (high) trust levels, LPI can adopt blockchain technology (punishment mechanism). [Submitted: 27 June 2020; Accepted: 20 November 2020]",

The purpose of this research is to outline the application of blockchain technology in the context of the subsidies distribution through the transfer of digital currency; also, a blockchain-based targeted subsidy system has been performed under the Ethereum network using solidity language. The written program is based on a platform extracted from the library research method and through the research conducted over recent years. This study aims to achieve an intelligent, autonomous, and self-executing subsidy distribution system. Furthermore, this study can make it possible for governments to provide a subsidy payment platform that can prevent data manipulation due to its decentralised nature, create a more reliable method for subsidy payments, and increase transparency in the distribution of subsidies.",

  "abstract": "The public key infrastructure (PKI) is the backbone of internet security. It ensures the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. The certified public keys are life-timed. They may be revoked upon personal change, private key exposure or misbehaviour occurrence. Their use is secure and traceable. Yet, this traceability trait and the identity-based certificate usage may violate the user's privacy. Therefore, there needs to be a balance between the accountability and authenticity requirements on the one hand and the privacy demand on the other hand. In this paper, we design a blockchain-based privacy-aware public key infrastructure system, which guarantees the same security properties besides ensuring the privacy. The users have two types of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) keys, identity-based long-term certified keys and on-the-fly temporal anonymous keys denoted as pseudonyms. These pseudonyms are stored and published on the blockchain. The proposed PKI achieves a similar security level as that of the conventional PKI while ensuring the privacy.",

  "abstract": "Unaccounted wealth (UW) is a large unsolved problem in India. The demonetisation exercise in November 2016 was an attempt to address it. As regulatory measures are taken to tackle UW, criminals identify newer ways to avoid detection, e.g., cryptocurrency usage for illicit activities, as it bypasses formal banking channels. This article examines evidence of change in cryptocurrency usage in the context of demonetisation. This is done by examining four datasets viz. keyword search for bitcoin (BTC), volume of BTC traded in India, price variation between USD/BTC/INR and BTC blockchain transaction dataset. The data indicates heightened awareness of cryptocurrency, increase in volume traded and increase in price spread between BTC/USD/INR, though unable to discern deviation in blockchain dataset due to India led transactions. Increasing BTC usage, given inability to regulate these transactions, supports move by Government of India to ban its usage till the technology and its implications are understood better.",

  "abstract": "Besides the recent adoption of outsourcing and open source business models, software factory is still a centralised process. In spite of the advantages of centralisation, it is widely accepted that decentralised systems are better alternatives; i.e., they are more scalable and reliable and more suitable for market sharing. The implementation of decentralised software factories demands solution of several technical challenges that conventional technology cannot solve. Emerging decentralised technologies (e.g., blockchain and smart contracts) can help to solve these challenges. Decentralised technologies are only emerging, consequently, their potential use to support software factories is a new research avenue. To cast some light on this emerging topic, in this article we provide an analysis of some centralised and decentralised architectures and raise research questions that need attention from the perspective of architecture selection. To frame the discussion, we focus our attention on software architectures for Model Driven Engineering, Asset Specifications and Integration Tools, resulting in a characterisation and analysis of possibilities for implementation of heterogeneous blockchain-oriented repositories.",

The emerging potentials of cryptocurrencies but the gap of practical application and respective existing knowledge are addressed in this paper. Technological, economic, social and regulatory aspects are depicted in the literature review. In addition, a comprehensive status quo of on companies' cryptocurrency adaptation research is provided and previous contributions are discussed. This study is based on an online questionnaire that was sent out to CFOs of German Prime Standard listed companies. As suggested in preceding papers the extended technology acceptance model (TAM2) is applied. Results indicate a very low level of adaptation and companies' utilisation of the blockchain technology. Lower potentials are seen in cryptocurrencies than in the underlying blockchain technology. The main obstacles are to overcome regulatory uncertainty and high price volatility. Low transaction costs and the omission of intermediaries are seen as great potential benefits. Suggestions for further research and practical implications are provided.",

Users information and identity leakage vulnerabilities possibly exist due to Bitcoins public address system. This attracts privacy issues. Practical and compatible anonymity requirements for users are still not satisfactory despite several attempts provided in existing techniques. In this paper, we propose a privacypreservation scheme that ensures users carry out anonymous bitcoin transactions based on bilinear pairing, elliptic curve cryptography, and other cryptographic primitives. We theoretically analysed and evaluate our scheme which is proven secure to implement for preserving users privacy in bitcoin transactions. Simulation performed proved the correctness of our scheme and show average performance time of 6 μs and 11 μs respectively for 80-bits and 128-bits with PBC Type A pairing. Effectively, the analysis and evaluation suggest the proposed scheme as secure and robust to implement for preserving users privacy in bitcoin transactions.",

Now the currency, rather than being physical is becoming more and more digital. Due to high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous bitcoin mining pools is increasing due to the fact that users together under a bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the bitcoins blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. In this research paper we are doing a survey on the technology lying underneath bitcoin's network and the various machine learning predictive algorithms. We collected the dataset on bitcoin blockchain from 28 April 2013 to 31 July 2017 which is publicly available on https://coinmarketcap.com and applied the ARIMA model for price prediction of bitcoin.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we explore access control area as one of the most crucial aspect of security and privacy in IoT. Actually, conventional security and privacy solutions tend to be less tailored for IoT. Then, designing a distributed access control with user-driven approach and privacy-preserving awareness in an IoT environment is of paramount importance. In this direction, we have investigated in our previous work a new way to build a distributed access control framework based on the blockchain technology through our proposed framework, FairAccess. The first version of FairAccess was based on the Bitcoin's UTXO model. However, this version presented limitations in expressing more granular access control policies. To tackle this issue, this paper upgrades the proposed framework to FairAccess2.0 that uses SmartContract concept instead of the locking/unlocking scripts. Thus, we show a possible working implementation based on ABAC policies, deployed on the ethereum blockchain. The obtained results show the efficiency of FairAccess2.0 and its compatibility with a wide range of existing access control models mainly the ABAC model. Finally, a performance and cost evaluation, discussion and future work are elaborated.",

  "abstract": "At present, the cross-chain technology works on becoming a bridge to build trust and transmit the information among chains. However, most of the existing schemes have poor universality, and they also have insufficient protection for the process of information cross-chain transmission. Contraposing the deficiencies above, we propose a channel matching scheme for cross-chain (CMSCC), CMSCC combines the ideas of the relay chain scheme and the channel in Fabric. The relay chain named chain-anchor and relay-chain (CARC) can be connected to other blockchains by multi-blockchain communication and consociation protocol (MBCCP). In CARC, the order peers will match the peers which on different chains and will create the peer matching channel (PMC) among matched peers. So, the information can be transmitted among matched peers. Finally, the experiment verifies that CMSCC enables information to be transmitted among chains through PMC, and CMSCC can also protect the process of information cross-chain transmission by PMC simultaneously.",

  "abstract": "It is undeniable that the growth of the computer and network security is repeatedly increased since the past 40 years. In 1985-1986 encryption was applied as a primary technique for providing security. Network security technology includes authentication and authorisation, data encryption, access control and security auditing. Bitcoin is presently one of the most popular crypto-currencies. The phenomenon of Bitcoin crypto-currencies is based on the public key cryptography and peer to peer network. In the Bitcoin, blockchain is used for storage of the transaction which is also called the public ledger. Digital money or Bitcoin is used in day to day activities, some of which are illicit and illegal. In this paper, the main area is security, i.e., the main focus here is to protect Bitcoin systems from unauthorised access and from various threats using an appropriate scheme (elliptic-curve cryptography, ECC) protocol.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain introduction has made a revolutionary change in the crypto currency around the world but it has not delivered on its promises of free and faster transaction confirmation. Serguei Popov's proposal of using tangles, a directed acyclic graph, which essentially is considered to be the successor of blockchains and offers the required features like machine to machine micro payment and fee-less transaction. It requires the user to approve the previous two transactions in the web to participate in the network. This essentially eliminates the miners and the mining part form the currency exchange and provides the user or participants to do their transactions fee-less. Since the participant verifies the previous two transactions it also contributes to the security of the tangle. In this paper, features of internet of things application (IOTA) and all the improvements in it using tangles are discussed along with how it contributed to the security and how it enables the participants to have fee-less transactions is also discussed.",

  "abstract": "This paper investigates how Bitcoin's (BTC) return volatility is affected by the main global financial market indicators, its own innovative aspects and uncertainty. First, the strategy consists in estimate structural break tests to find significative regime switching in BTC returns. Next, conditional volatility parameters are estimated from multivariate perspective using the DCC-MGARCH model. At this stage, the Standard & Poor 500 index, China's SSEC stock index and the price of gold were used to estimate the quasi-covariances and quasi-correlations matrices of global drivers of BTC returns. In the last stage, impulse response functions are also estimated, in order to understand how BTC returns are affected by risk and uncertainty shocks. There are many factors and uncertainty surrounding the BTC market microstructure and indicators of a speculative bubble from the end of 2017 to mid-2018. The findings seem to point to barriers for investors and development of blockchain benefits.",

Over time, with the rapid spread of the virus, COVID-19 became a serious concern to people all over the world. The outbreak of the virus prompted many cities and countries to enact lockdown laws to try to control the epidemic. These global lockdowns have done a lot of damage to the world economy. For this reason, different countries of the world have tried to use various technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), drones, etc., to reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 and minimise the damage to the economy by telecommuting methods. In this paper, we briefly review the impact of using these technologies during the outbreak of epidemics such as COVID-19.",

Therefore, this contribution critically reviews the latest developments on big data analytics and programmatic advertising. Moreover, it sheds light on the use of blockchain; as this distributed ledger technology provides secure, verified transactions among marketplace stakeholders. The findings suggest that the service providers are increasingly utilising data-driven technologies including programmatic advertising tools to target and re-target individuals online or on their mobile. However, individuals and organisations are becoming increasingly aware on data protection issues, as they often block marketers from tracking them and serving them ads. In conclusion, this contribution puts forward a theoretical framework that explains how, why, where and when practitioners are capturing, analysing and distributing data. In sum, it implies that the data-driven technologies are facilitating the businesses' customer-centric marketing.",

IoT-cloud-based architecture is insufficient to handle the requirement of IoT like latency, bandwidth, and volume of data. Fog computing can address those problems by providing processing and services to end-users at the edge network. In centralised system computation and processing was done in a centralised way. Some of the issues in that centralised system are malicious behaviour, node capture, and failure. The solution for this would be if multiple parties do the computation then the decision can be reliable, trustworthy. In this paper, authors first used IoT-fog-cloud architecture to explain the need to multi-party computation in IoT applications. Secondly, authors review existing work in term of the basic working principle of multi-party computation and already used applications area. Lastly paper described the solution approach to perform the secure multi-party computation in term of blockchain technology.",

  "abstract": "In recent times, blockchain has encouraged innovations to handle challenges in many practical applications in which traditional approaches are not found to be successful. This work has proposed a game theory-based approach for consensus building in a distributed network. In this work, the wearable kidney model is analysed to understand the working of the game-theory-based consensus model. The lightweight consensus algorithm consumes fewer resources (suitable for resource constraint devices) and provides an efficient solution to simulate the functionality of a wearable kidney model. The comparative analysis of the result shows that the proposed approach is efficient in fast bit-matching and quick consensus establishment and the kidney blood and urine production are mapped to almost ideal conditions, and variations in delay for bit-matching and algorithm executions are evaluated after that. The comparative analysis shows that algorithm 1 outperforms (at least 2.1%) algorithm 2 in delay analysis because of less distributed functionality.",

  "abstract": "The rapid evolution of the internet, particularly the emergence of Web3, has transformed the ways people interact and share data. Web3, although still not well defined, is thought to be a return to the decentralisation of corporations' power over user data. Despite the obsolescence of the idea of building systems to detect and prevent cyber intrusions, this is still a topic of interest. This paper proposes a novel conceptual approach for implementing decentralised collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDN) through a proof-of-concept. The study employs an analytical and comparative methodology, examining the synergy between cutting-edge Web3 technologies and information security. The proposed model incorporates blockchain concepts, cyber non-fungible token (cyberNFT) rewards, machine learning algorithms, and publish/subscribe architectures. Finally, the paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the proposed system, offering insights into the potential of decentralised cybersecurity models.",

  "abstract": "The interplanetary file system (IPFS) has been used more and more widely because of its advantages of smooth integration with the current blockchain platform and its advantages as a distributed file system. However, the authors found that IPFS has some privacy issues; it cannot completely avoid unauthorised access to data by malicious nodes. In response to this problem, the authors propose a lightweight encryption scheme based on the characteristics of IPFS file slicing combined with AES256 and SHA256, which can be smoothly integrated into IPFS. During the upload process, this scheme encrypts some sliced file blocks according to the strategy formulated by the user. During the download process, the encrypted block is identified and decrypted according to a special encryption method. Through this scheme, the system can increase file security without affecting the performance of IPFS itself and retain the deduplication effect of IPFS to the utmost extent.",

  "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the internet of things (IoT), huge amounts of multimedia data are being generated from and/or exchanged through various IoT devices, systems and applications. The security and privacy of multimedia data have, however, emerged as key challenges that have the potential to impact the successful deployment of IoT devices in some data-sensitive applications. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on multimedia data security and privacy protection in the IoT. First, we classify multimedia data into different types and security levels according to application areas. Then, we analyse and discuss the existing multimedia data protection schemes in the IoT, including traditional techniques (e.g., cryptography and watermarking) and emerging technologies (e.g., blockchain and federated learning). Based on the detailed analysis on the research development of IoT-related multimedia security and privacy protection, we point out some open challenges and provide future research directions, aiming to advance the study in the relevant fields and assist researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of the state of the art on multimedia data protection in the IoT.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is a new technique developed to eliminate central management of information by dividing maintenance between validators interested in participating for an expected reward. Unlike previous work, this invested in the practical impossibility of dealing with a large number of maintainers who may be business owners expecting a reward or aiming to foster the ecosystem. Inspired by the proverb \"solidarity is not an act of charity, but mutual aid between forces fighting for the same goal.\" This work introduces Missa, which is a way to foster trust between different maintainers and the platform by exchanging valuable data structures to provide a new approach to maintaining ledger validity in a fast, reliable, and secure manner. The solution was evaluated in terms of security discussion, environmental modelling, formal study of important components, and conceptual comparison. Finally, an actor model implementation, network simulation and unit tests were demonstrated.",

  "abstract": "The concept of coin mixing is significant in blockchain and achieves anonymity and has merited application in bitcoin. Albeit, several coin mixing schemes have been proposed, we point out that they either hoard input transactions and address mapping or not fully satisfy all requirements of practical anonymity. This paper proposes a coin mixing scheme (mixing countersignature scheme, ring signature, and coin mixing approach) that allows users to transact business untraceably and unlinkably without having to trust a third party to ensure coins are safe. Our proposed novel countersignature scheme simulation results prove the countersignature scheme's correctness with an average running time of 4 μs using PBC type A.80. The scheme's security and privacy are met with standard ring signature, ECDSA unforgeability and our countersignature. We demonstrated the efficiency of the mixing scheme using bitcoin's core regtest mode to set up a private bitcoin network. The mix takes 80, 160, 320, 640, 800 secs to service 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 5,000 users respectively. It was observed that the number of users scales linearly with average running time.",

Cryptocurrencies were thought to be very promising and boomed feverously in the hope that it might be capable of replacing the traditional currency. On this background, the paper has following objectives: 1) to compare the fiat money with cryptocurrency; 2) to study the potential of cryptocurrency of being capable of replacing the fiat money; 3) to propose the framework to evaluate the sustainability of the possible candidates to be the dominating currency. The researchers have applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to derive ratio scales from paired comparisons and rated the expected performances for two alternatives. Nine factors were selected with the hierarchical structure to measure the relative performance of proposed candidates. The results found that fiat money is still preferred to cryptocurrency due to many reasons.",

  "abstract": "Bitcoin transactions rely on digital signatures to prove the ownership of bitcoin. The private signing key of the bitcoin owner is the key component to enable a bitcoin transaction. If the signing key of a bitcoin is stolen, the thief who possesses the key can make a transaction of the bitcoin. In this paper, based on the distance-based encryption (DBE), we propose an enhanced version of bitcoin in order to protect the signing key. Our approach is based on our two-factor authentication, where the signing key cannot be retrieved without being identified via the password and biometric authentication scheme, and the user is only required to enter his password and fingerprint (or other biometric information such as a factual image) to retrieve the key. By doing this, we can effectively improve the bitcoin security and provide stronger authentication. An attractive feature of our scheme is that one of encryption schemes is asymmetric, in the sense that the decryption key (biometric information) is not stored in the device. We also provide the security model and proof to justify the security of our scheme.",

Given the focus of the central banks all over the world, we will discuss three main aspects: technology, economics and regulation. Technology seems to be the most important revolution brought by cryptocurrencies: it is employed for many purposes that depart from the original one of distributed ledger for storing transactions. The traditional financial intermediaries are trying to prevent the disruption of the current financial system by cooperating with the FinTech start-ups. Regarding the economic aspect, we deal with the comparison between what academia has been proposing for incorporating cryptocurrencies in the economy and what central banks and banks are doing. Regulation has mainly adopted a 'wait and see approach' and it is very fragmented around the globe. Regulation is mainly oriented in exploiting technology, acquiring the new name of RegTech.",

  "abstract": "Cryptocurrency is a type of virtual or digital currency, which relies on a distributed ledger network (DLT) to combine the core ideas of cryptography with a monetary system to create an anonymous, traceable, secure, and potentially stable currency over the world. Cryptocurrency is organic in nature in a way that it is neither issued nor regulated by any central authority, which makes it immune to any interference from banking regulations. It has been credited with creating unprecedented changes in the economic world. This study comes under exploration analysis. The data is collected from the EBSCO database between March 25, 2020 and December 15, 2020. The prime objectives are to understand the system of cryptocurrency, its viability for industry, and try to foresee its future in the current business world. This manuscript elaborates different aspects of cryptocurrencies, starting from the history and their evolution over time, explaining how a cryptocurrency transaction system works, and its impact on our daily life – business as well as economy. In addition, the manuscript covers issues related to the practical and technical functions. The article also describes the cryptocurrencies practices in India as well as worldwide.",

Efficacy of the algorithms is assessed in terms of the block dependability that expresses the probability for the pending transactions to be posted within the current or the target block delay. Algorithms on prioritising and sampling transactions from pool, to facilitate execution of those transactions within their deadline requirements, such as normal, random, sorted, and stratified, are proposed and simulated. Performance variables such as the number of pending transactions, average speed, gas fees, deadlines, number of miners, are identified and taken into the block dependability in order to reveal the influence of those variables. Extensive parametric simulation results are presented and discussed in the cases of the random and sorted transaction sampling algorithms along with a prototype built based on the Ethereum open source.",

  "abstract": "Because the existing wind turbine safety is limited by the traditional centralised management, it faces many security risks. Therefore, the future wind turbine management and control scheme is developing towards distributed security and high performance. Relying on Ethereum block technology to build smart contracts can help solve the security protection problems of network authority control and management in wind power energy systems. First, based on the analysis of wind power network security management needs, establish a mathematical model of security indicators for the control centre and subordinate nodes, respectively, when the permissions are out of control; second, based on the Ethereum smart contract release platform, according to the mathematical model of security indicators run wind power contract management (WPCM), predict the results of out-of-control simulation, and compare with the communication parameters of a typical wind farm in Northwest Europe. Studies have shown that the established wind power energy network security management plan has the characteristics of high security and good robustness, and the system processing speed is fast, which meets the offshore wind farm communication standard.",

FinTech as coined has another side from which digital currency evolved. The advent of digital finance (such as cryptocurrency) excited the crypto-arbitrageurs due to the gain in wealth without considering the legality and risks associated with its transactions. Meanwhile, making cryptocurrency a store of value and/or speculating with it, may cart away huge investible fund from individuals and the economy at large. There are many more risks associated with cryptocurrency. Therefore, there is a need for regulation of the cryptocurrency towards protection and harnessing the generative potential of the currency. Meanwhile, the approach should be gain-gain by the way of regulation for use and integration of the cryptocurrency possibilities towards the provision of efficient and effective (financial) services in all sectors.",

An artwork that is made by a creator or an artist is initially placed into the cyberspace by uploading it. This is a process known as minting or uploading the artwork into an online marketplace for sale. In some circumstances, however, the person uploading the artwork onto the online marketplace for digital products is not the copyright owner of the artwork and does not have permission to do so.

  "abstract": "For decentralised cryptocurrency systems, it is important to provide users an efficient network. One performance bottleneck is the latency issue. To address this issue, we provide four protocols to utilise the resources based on the traffic in the network to alleviate the latency in the network. To facilitate the verification process, we discuss three variant injection protocols: Periodic Injection of Transaction via Evaluation Corridor (PITEC), Probabilistic Injection of Transactions (PIT) and Adaptive Semi-synchronous Transaction Inject (ASTI). The injection protocols are variants based on the given assumptions of the network. The goal is to provide dynamic injection of unverified transactions to enhance the performance of the network. The Adaptive Policy Optimisation (APO) protocols aim at optimising a cryptocurrency system's own house policy. The house policy optimisation is translated into a 0/1 knapsack problem. The APO protocol is a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the decentralised ledger system.",

  "abstract": "A paradigm shift in machine learning (ML) application models has occurred in the preceding years due to privacy and deep learning aspirations. The recently created decentralised paradigm of ML is known as federated learning. Federated learning (FL) is a ML technique in which many dispersed nodes use their locally stored data to train a common prediction model. Better data privacy is possible because the training data is not routed to a central server. FL offloads the processed information to the server and does not need clients to share their personal information. However, FL is a new field that has yet to achieve mainstream acceptance and is still in the development phase. In this context, the purpose of our study is to provide a more comprehensive overview of the most important protocols, platforms, and real-world FL use cases, which will allow researchers to develop privacy-preserving solutions for businesses that require FL.",

  "abstract": "Distributed ledger technology (DLT) provides decentralised services by removing the need of trust among distributed nodes in the distributed system. Transactions across the network are visible to all participants. However, some transactions may contain sensitive information such as business contracts or even personal health records. To protect user privacy, the architecture of distributed multi-channel ledger with membership service as a critical component can be adopted. The proposed multi-channel membership service architecture combines two promising technologies, distributed ledger and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). With SGX remote attestation and isolated execution, each node is enrolled as a trusted entity to the channels, which separate different applications and provide better flexibility. We propose security properties for membership service in distributed ledger and illustrate how SGX help to achieve these properties in each phase. Security analysis and evaluation show that the proposed architecture could enhance the privacy preservation and capabilities against attacks.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing is gaining increasing popularity among enterprises, universities, government departments, and end-users. Geographically distributed users can collaborate by sharing files through the cloud. Ciphertext-Policy attribute-based (CP-ABE) access control provides an efficient technique to enforce fine-grained access control by the data owner. Single authority CP-ABE schemes create a bottleneck for enterprise applications. Multi authority CP-ABE systems deal with multiple attribute authorities performing the attribute registration or key distribution. Type I pairing is used in designing the existing multi-authority systems. They are vulnerable to some reported known attacks on them. This paper proposes a multi-authority CP-ABE scheme that supports attribute and policy revocation. Type III pairing is used in designing the scheme, which has higher security, faster group operations, and requires less memory to store the elements. The proposed scheme has been implemented using the Charm framework, which uses the PBC library. The OpenStack cloud platform is used for computing and storage services. It has been proved that the proposed scheme is collusion resistant, traceable, and revocable. AVISPA tool has been used to verify that the proposed scheme is secure against a replay attack and man-in-the-middle attack.",

While not highly correlated to the US stock market performance, cryptocurrency returns are positively correlated with both technology and materials sectors within the US stock market. The results present a case for valuing cryptocurrencies as both a financial asset and a technological advancement.",

Since the start of the COVID-19, there has been an increasing trend towards digitisation and digitised services which have created a need for safe and secure digital identities. One of these manifestations is the cryptocurrency phenomenon. Cryptocurrencies have become even more important as a solution to the financial and economic challenges faced by many developing countries during the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, where cryptocurrencies are concerned, most of the research done has been preoccupied with the current and future role of the industrialised and developing countries. Not surprisingly, virtually little research has been undertaken to examine the contributive value of cryptocurrencies for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Using exploratory case study methodology and document analysis, this study attempts to fill the gap in the literature by exploring the possible contributive value of this technology for SIDS.",

While the traditional banking channel has been engaged in meeting the challenges of inclusive growth, there is an emergence of financial technology companies providing services and products similar and parallel to banking. Even as FinTech seems to redefine the service quality and product delivery through innovative use of technology in design and delivery of financial products and services, there is a need to moderate the hype and introduce a robust regulatory framework to ensure their service orientation over and above the pure commercial instinct.

  "abstract": "In this paper, utilising the cost-benefit analysis we evaluate a unique supplementary concept to the traditional intellectual property protection and the long-term social-economic feasibility of Save-ideas company. Many creative innovators have ideas about solving problems, improving lives, increasing productivity, preventing damage, saving money, etc. But unfortunately, most of these people do not have the money, nor the time to go down the conventional IPR protection route. With changes brought about by the internet and crowd participation, new options to address this problem have emerged. Such a new solution is the save-ideas.com platform. The result of the analysis clearly justified used resources, while consequently straightening determination on continuation of the Save-Ideas (SIs) project with the current vision.",

  "abstract": "The emergence of cryptocurrencies has motivated the central banks to issue a centralised and trusted digital currency instead of fiat currency named central bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDC is a substitute for fiat currency to meet some wants instead of cryptocurrency. However, it is still in the testing stage and has some challenges that should be addressed and focused on. The study of different research papers and published articles show three significant issues and many minor issues that reflect CBDC's challenges, including its functional limitations due to its used technology features, its effects on monetary policy, and its effects on commercial banks. The primary purpose of this study is to concisely present the previous work on the above three mentioned issues.",

  "abstract": "Cryptocurrency becomes an integral part of modern financial markets all over the globe, meanwhile, in many states, there is no legal regulation of cryptocurrency. To elaborate legal framework legislators should understand the nature and purpose of cryptocurrency. Basing on the experience of Russia and Nigeria authors show that it is unacceptable and impossible to treat cryptocurrency as money, it has more features of the unit of account. Therefore, cryptocurrency is a new instrument for risky investments. However, the national government has a lot to gain, revenue and generative technology wise if cryptocurrency could be recognised to be what it is and legislated, instead of shying away from its recognition and legislation. The authors believe that the international character of transactions involving cryptocurrency shows that its legal regulation should be based on the sole general model adopted on the international level by multilateral international agreement.",

  "abstract": "This paper provides a solution to the educational certification issue by employing the blockchain network. The proposed permissioned blockchain network is implemented in hyperledger fabric. The proposed system provides various services to issuing institutions: verifying organisation; identification and authentication of the issuer; verify and securely share academic records to the recipients; and stores the academic records in the blockchain in a distributed manner, ensuring the privacy of stored records of the recipient. When compared to Ethereum, hyperledger fabric provides additional functionalities like efficient parallelism, concurrency, multiple transaction executions, and efficient commitments of the transaction into the ledger. The experimental analysis of the proposed system has been executed to test the performance of invoking and query transactions using Hyperledger Caliper. We analyse the throughput and transaction latency of the proposed work as well. The experimental results exhibit the proposed system achieves better transaction processing power and security compared to existing systems.",

  "abstract": "Growing digitisation has made data ownership an important focus for institutions and students. Broadly, there are three issues, which require urgent attention to obtain data privacy, literacy, and utilisation. First, schools globally lack necessary frameworks for data interoperability, while maintaining privacy and control. Second, the scale, source, and nature of school data make its interoperability impractical, resulting in an inability to assess the true impact of educational technologies on learning. Third, while data supports teaching, an increasingly data-driven decision-making suggests that student participation in curriculum design becomes secondary. Finding a balance between data-driven decision-making and student voice is critical for an efficient school ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce a proof-of-concept for Kratos: an immutable decentralised data management system that enables privacy, applied data literacy while empowering students with a user interface for data governance and active participation in school processes.",

  "abstract": "Digital asset prices have been highly volatile, and it is hard to understand their fair value as you would with traditional assets. There has been some research to consider how cryptocurrencies and digital assets can be valued. However, there are no mainstream valuation theories that have still been developed. This paper undertakes a survey of some of the methods utilised to perform this valuation in practice at present. Though, as cryptocurrencies have a significant technology component, as a result, the existing valuation models being used in the industry are different to the traditional valuation models. This paper intends to review traditional asset valuation models like the CAPM and APT. When reviewing industry-based models that are used to value digital assets, we notice that neither of these models provides a simplistic way of analysing the fair value of digital assets. Therefore, this paper develops the volatility-based digital asset model to show how traditional and digital assets can be valued using a standard model.",

  "abstract": "Transport layer security protocols ensure secure and encrypted communications on the internet. The security of TLS protocols relies on properly validating digital certificates containing the public keys of domains during the handshake authentication. These certificates are issued by certificate authorities (CAs). However, mis-issued certificates have been used to attack users. To monitor CA behaviour, certificate transparency (CT) and a decentralised system, instant karma public key infrastructure (IKP) were proposed, however, they do not tackle domain misbehaviour. Based on CT and IKP, a decentralised system is proposed using the Ethereum framework to handle the misbehaviour of domains and enhance the security of TLS. The proposed system utilises CT logs to detect and respond to domain misbehaviour.",

  "abstract": "The technology adoption cycle in the public sector is usually much longer than in the private sector. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an acceleration in the adoption of various digital tools which serve as a bridge between the public and private sector. These digital tools include instantaneous contact tracing mobile applications (apps) used to alert individuals who have recently been in contact with an infected person and used by governments to manage public health policies. From the perspective of individuals' data storage there are two general possible approaches, namely centralised and decentralised. Each approach has some legal and ethical considerations, mostly related to finding the right balance between the individual's privacy and public health. In this paper we will outline how privacy according to the design principle should be applied as a minimum standard when developing government approved contact tracking apps.",

While being able to react to such disruptions is important, it is even more vital for supply chains to be proactive in a Covid-19 reality. Companies need to be adapting to changes in how customer relationships are maintained within digital supply chain (DSC) platforms. With more and more people working remotely, companies must still ensure their customer relationships are being maintained. This is one example of a supply chain challenge that this paper looks to unfold. By highlight the importance of digital platforms in e-procurement, increased technology and transparency are vital to successful companies, either B2C, B2B. Companies who are willing to learn and adapt become more competitive. The paper briefly dives into SAP Ariba and Jaggaer, and their role in aiding e-procurement and CRM.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, an algorithm has been developed to evaluate the performance of omni channel distribution network configurations based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) models and consensus formation. At first, bi-objective input- and output-oriented simultaneous DEA models are developed to evaluate the configurations with respect to two common criteria, i.e., the service and cost, and the transparency criterion which is defined based on the blockchain technology. Then, a consensus is formed on the evaluation results, based on a risk-based optimisation model. The proposed models are solved by fuzzy goal programming. In addition, the application of the proposed models is demonstrated through a case study in the context of the Indian retail industry. The computational results extracted from the optimisation models developed in our paper showed that the transparency criterion is very effective in the configurations evaluations and scores.",

This theoretical paper proposes a conceptual model intended to illuminate the factors that influence a consumer to disclose personal information over the internet. More importantly, this paper proposes a model to understand a proposed connection between this willingness to disclose personal information, and the use of self-sovereign identity technology. This model was tested empirically using an online survey of 347 adult South Africans and utilised partial least squares structural equation modelling. A novel connection between the intention to use self-sovereign identity technology and the willingness to provide personal information was confirmed. Additionally, past experience with a company, reputation of a company, type of personal information requested, benefits, consumer characteristics and control were shown to be significant influencers of the willingness to disclose personal information.",

In recent years, software development has received considerable attention because of its interpretation of the model topics originating from natural language processing. In this article, the application and development of semantic software development emphasise the understanding of semantic software development. Furthermore, literature was reviewed and evaluated in detail based on semantic software development models to the clustering-based random probability distribution model (CRPDM). However, the related studies offered an outlook for the use of topical models to create semantic software applications according to the types of models based on the random probability entity. The simulation of CRPDM improves the accuracy and performance of analysing semantic software applications. Furthermore, the theme models are a promising method in semantic software development research for different applications that have been firmly researched in this paper.",

We enhance previous semantic analyses that were aimed at measuring this alignment. In addition to an analysis that compares the entire claim and description section, we suggest an analysis, which compares on the level of so-called claim elements. We test both analyses on a patent set concerning blockchain technology. We manage to suggest a new typology of different alignment patterns, separating between predominantly, consistently, and poorly supported patents. Furthermore, a combination of both analysis types leads to a higher resolution for the understanding of alignment. Practitioners may use the suggested alignment measurements to classify their own as well as third party patents in order to understand the application style. Furthermore, they can identify those independent claims within a granted patent or a patent application, which are not sufficiently supported by the description.",

  "abstract": "A common approach to attract potential cloud users is to offer a two-stage pricing strategy to enhance the perceived value. This value is based on the willingness of diverse cloud users to pay and the market stages of cloud storage providers (CSPs). However, the risk of breaching cloud security in the free trial stage due to the sharing of personal cloud storage products (PCSPs) may decrease the number of cloud users. Consequently, the study proposes a two-stage pricing strategy to make a trade-off between the cloud security risk and the perceived value. Furthermore, it aims to uncover the conditions under different security risk coefficients. It selects the optimal pricing strategy to help CSPs determine the free trial time and optimal price. Our findings can provide helpful insight in devising an optimal pricing strategy by CSPs considering security risks, which assures the safety of PCSPs and benefits CSPs by increasing profits.",

  "abstract": "A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that can be used via peer-to-peer networks to execute secure electronic transactions without the need for a central control authority. The goals of this review are to identify how blockchain-based cryptocurrency is affecting the financial system, and to analyse the motivation for establishing cryptocurrency regulation, legislation, law and standards. The research methodology used to conduct this research was the systematic literature review. We conclude that the regulation of cryptocurrency requires the interaction of multiple stakeholders in order to incorporate financial, legal, technological and civil society dimensions. Coordination between several dimensions is necessary since each dimension has specific requirements associated with cryptocurrency usage, and each also has drivers that could involve different stakeholders with potentially competing interests. Most of these drivers are related to the financial, social, legal and technological aspects of regulation, and vice-versa.",

In the first phase ,a qualitative study was done to identify the critical success factors which enable organisations to attain potential benefits. In the second phase, they were prioritised using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach. Through analysis, economic factors were found to be the most important factors followed by environmental and social factors. The results also provided an insight into the global ranking of all the critical success factors.",

Blockchain-style consensus has emerged to solve this problem, but there is still a gaping need for faster, more scalable, and reliably safe consensus protocols. We show that many classical consensus protocols give rise naturally to a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which we call the message DAG. We restructure two classical consensus protocols via the message DAG, consolidating message rounds with new messages, to achieve manifestly improved scalability. The second protocol lends itself to a scalable blockchain consensus protocol with strong safety and liveness guarantees. We also present a technique to generalise other message-based, classical consensus protocols.",

However, with the introduction of the blockchain technology, it is much easier to disintermediate the basic building blocks of banking. Most banks depend on savings accounts to support their lending activities and through financial intermediation make significant profits. This paper shows how political economy and blockchain technology can allow this banking function to be changed into a market tradable product; in effect, removing the restrictions that exist across banks. Further, interest rates across the global economy should reduce, as this market-based mechanism should reduce interest rates through better competition and it should completely remove the require for the central bank to act as a lender of last resort and as a result removing the idea of moral hazard.",

Therefore, to enable the interaction of values between heterogeneous blockchains, we propose a cross-chain mechanism based on a generic global relay chain strategy and a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain system. Also, an unused transaction output (UTXO) verification mechanism based on RSA accumulator is proposed to address the shortcomings of using simplified payment verification (SPV) to verify transactions. In this paper, five experimental tests were performed: pressure, stability, response time, throughput, and latency. Experiments show that its computational complexity for cross-chain transaction validation remains constant as the number of transactions increases. Thus, an efficient cross-chain value transfer is achieved.",

  "abstract": "The advent of cryptocurrencies has tremendously revolutionised the global financial system, facilitating borderless and seamless financial transactions. However, the high volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies, its decentralised network and lack of formal regulation pose severe threats to the monetary policy role of central banks. Hence, this study explored the dynamics of cryptocurrencies and how it affects the monetary policy roles of central banks. The study showed that cryptocurrencies help foster the actualisation of cashless economies and seamless international transactions but its lack of international coordination has continued to undermine tapping optimally into its inherent benefits. Therefore, this study emphasised the imperativeness of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for effective financial sector regulation and protection of users of this financial innovation. This would broaden the central banks' horizon and expand their capacities to harness the potential of this novel financial innovation for the effective administration of conventional and unconventional monetary policies.",

  "abstract": "Libra, announced in June of 2019 by Facebook and later rebranded to Diem, has not been released yet. This paper investigates Diem's possible effects on unbanked people and shows the most critical factors for targeting people without bank accounts. The report also elaborates on Diem's market potential. To further investigate the existing research gap, relevant literature is examined, and technical characteristics are given. In addition to that, eight experts from the areas 'cryptocurrencies', 'blockchain', 'fintech', and 'finance and banking' are interviewed on the topic. The paper finds that Diem can achieve broad adoption in emerging markets, increase financial inclusion and facilitate remittances. However, this can only be achieved if the current hurdles of the project are overcome. In particular, important is an agreement with regulators. The paper also estimates how much revenue this project could generate and what problems and risks could arise regarding negative interest rates and data protection.",

  "abstract": "The crypto world promises all peer-to-peer transactions disconnected from government regulations. Movement to decentralise financial institutions (DeFi), via blockchain technology, was underpinned by a belief of using smart contracts. Finance encompasses all transactions between Today Goods and tomorrow goods (TDTM). This trading world is currently under construction. According to Fisher, trading with future entails fundamental TDTM principles. According to Coase, all contracts are subjected to transaction costs. The success of DeFi ultimately must answer to how transaction costs are lowered in TDTM. The 2020 world pandemic fuelled crypto activities. If crypto can live up to its promise for reducing transaction costs, a fiat world inflation is actually a crypto world deflation. Existing real investment in the crypto world can increase or decrease the marginal product of capital, DeFi Rate is different from the real interest rate. This article interprets the findings in the framework of Fisher and Coase.",

  "abstract": "Distributed machine learning can give an adaptable but strong shared condition for the design of trusted AI applications; this is mainly due to lack of privacy of centralised remote learning mechanisms. This notwithstanding, also distributed approaches have been compromised by several attack models (mainly data poisoning): in such a situation, a malicious member of the learning party may inject bad data. As such applications are growing in criticality, learning models must face with security and protection just as with versatility issues. The aim of the paper is to improve these applications by providing extra security features for distributed and federated learning mechanisms: more in the details, the paper examines specific concerns such as the utilisation of blockchain, homomorphic cryptography and meta-modelling techniques to ensure protection as well as other non-functional properties.",

  "abstract": "Lots of existing work addresses the analysis of Bitcoin's publicly available transaction graph. There are evaluations of the user's anonymity and privacy, but no proper measurements of the underlying network. This paper presents novel insights about Bitcoin's P2P network, with a focus on the distribution among autonomous systems. The resilience of Bitcoin's ecosystem, the unambiguousness of the blockchain, the propagation and verification of transaction blocks, but also the anonymity of Bitcoin's users depend on the structure of the global network. Our work is the first thorough analysis of Bitcoin's underlying network, especially with regard to its distribution at autonomous system level. We traversed Bitcoin's network and made statements about the size of the accessible network and the number of clients. Further, we investigated the network's distribution on autonomous systems. Finally, we analysed the mechanism to announce known peers. It turns out that Bitcoin's peer announcement is not well-distributed, affecting information propagation.",

  "abstract": "The increasing amount of data provides an excellent opportunity for the processing and analysis of big data. Big data serves various fields, such as transportation, medical care, consumption, etc. The analysis and processing of big data greatly facilitates our life. When we consider the convenience provided by big data, we should also consider the security issues involved behind it. The loss of protection of data resources will cause great distress to the society and individuals. In recent years, the leakage of data resources has become a troublesome problem in the field of big data. The emergence of access control technology adds a barrier to the access of data resources, avoids some illegal users' access to resources, and reduces the problem of resource leakage to a certain extent. This paper summarises the development of some access control technologies in the field of big data access control, including discretionary access control technology, role-based access control technology, attribution-based access control technology, blockchain-based access control technology, etc. Then it summarises the application characteristics of access control technology in the field of big data, and finally looks forward to the development prospect of access control.",

  "abstract": "The transport and logistics system has always been an attractive sector for investments and entrepreneurship. Its importance becomes increasingly stressed by the advance in technology and the advent of digitalisation. Consequently, the digital economy opens new possibilities for optimising the transport and logistics section of national economies. Thus, this paper proposed and developed a conceptual model of digitalisation of transport and logistics in Russia, a developing country where this sector may represent many entrepreneurship potentialities. The suggested model is based on new technologies related to Industry 4.0 as blockchain, big data, the internet of things, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. Accordingly, this paper pointed out the key factors of digitalisation of the industry: a) accessibility of financing; b) availability of digital technologies of Industry 4.0; c) public support for digitalisation of transport and logistics and consumer preferences. Interestingly, the paper offers an intriguing economic approach to understand players' behaviours potential strategies based on the Prisoner's dilemma. This provides some useful recommendations to public policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs to govern the digitalisation of transport and logistics in Russia.",

The solutions to enable access to these works include the use of fair defence, the extended collective licensing regime, the scheme for reappearing copyright holders, and the blockchain-based system. None of these options, however, have included an open innovation framework as part of the solutions. Therefore, this paper aspires to explore the suitability of Chesbrough's open innovation concept. This paper discusses two underlying theories for the exploitation of the orphan works and further highlights the suitability of the open innovation concept based on the said theories. This paper further argues that the open-innovation based model is suitable for the exploitation of the orphan works because it may encourage grassroots innovations and promote sustainable economic growth through one of open innovation's mechanisms, IP licensing.",

  "abstract": "Financial technology (FinTech) is an evolving concept that has previously produced little historical evidence or statistically significant time series data for analysis, leaving only a theoretical framework to be worked on or sponsored by large advisory firms. Strategic advisory firms have already put the emerging FinTech trend at the top of their agendas, with the aim of better understanding future scenarios for universal banks. There has been abundant theoretical literature existing on the implication of emerging FinTech globally, but there is still a dither in quantitative analysis. This study aims to understand the impact of financial technology implementation on the profitability of Indian banks. The study considers return on assets (ROAs) and return on equity (ROE) as dependent variables, and independent variables include number of ATMs to bank branches ratio, capital equity tier 1 ratio, cost to income ratio and FinTech dummy (encompasses blockchain, artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, payment technology, and cloud computing). The results display a significant positive impact of FinTech adoption on banks' profitability. Financial institutions delivering tailored products and services, successful in combining pace and flexibility, are having far more wide-reaching dynamics in comparison to their antiquated predecessors.",

In recent years, many studies have been carried out on scalability, interoperability and resource constraints, such as the computational and energy strategies that machine learning (ML) uses to solve many data protection problems. This paper reviews these studies and aims to explore the possibilities and challenges of using data in ML-based solutions for IoT privacy. First, we explore and introduce various data sources into the IoT, and then classify them. We are also reviewing it and developing solutions developed based on existing ML and IoT to protect privacy. Finally, we'll look at how much specific data is used for privacy through ML-based solutions, and look at how these data sources can be used in the IoT ecosystem.",

  "abstract": "Automobile industries' rapid development on modern wireless vehicle communication among vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside information units has been termed the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The significant challenges of the IoV include vehicle data management and congestion in the network. In this research, Big Data analytics integrated the IoT framework (BDA-IoTF) is proposed to process the data received from the roadside units to minimise congestion and optimised data management. Further, the vehicle data has been analysed for several conditions that help to analyse the network congestion. Based on the congestion level, BDA-IoTF helps evaluate the vehicles' performance in correlation with data management. This Big Data analytics gives immense support in segregation, management, and data collection based on IoT, by sending data directly to the database using wireless radio frequency technology. The proposed BDA-IoTF has been validated based on the optimisation parameter, which outperforms conventional methods. Thus the experimental results show the BDA-IoTF improve vehicle data management (96.2%) and minimising the traffic congestion (21.4%) with high performance (95.6%), accuracy (98.2%), and error rate (16.7%), efficiency (93.8%), transportation optimisation (94.1%), delay time (18.5%) when compared to other methods.",

The paper adopts the computable general equilibrium model with the GTAP 10 database to achieve the objective. Three scenarios are built to measure the ramifications of this structural transformation. The paper concludes that there will be mixed results for different sectors, and governments of these countries have to step forward to bridge the gap created by the advent of new technologies such as blockchain, and artificial intelligence and robotics. Governments will have to find answers to some pertinent questions such as what policies are required to be framed to enjoy the benefits of technological changes and how can the functioning of labour markets be improved in view of the technological revolution. They will also have to ensure inclusiveness and income equality through new policies.",

Adopting systematic and historical methods of research, the dialectic of two typological structures of financial ties is considered. The interaction of distributed network structures with equal subjects of economic activity and hierarchical institutional structures with state participation is explored. It is revealed that with the development of innovations and financial technologies, the use of distributed network channels is increasing. The conclusion is made that there are potentially two strategic approaches for the development of banks: evolutionary and revolutionary, involving in the first case the transformation of their classical business model into a technology company, and in the second, full absorption by alternative distributed services, based on block technologies and consumer power.",

Lightweight items, lower errors, minimum tool costs, optimum components usage, and feasible manufacturing method are depending on field implementation. Smart agents powered by AI can help minimise the number of people needed to raise AM productivity with the simultaneous improvement in source usage. The present state of AI-enabled AM item enhancement is explored in this paper. Artificial intelligence (AI), digitalised reality, internet of things (IoT), blockchain, driverless cars, and future innovations are all dependent on 5G's lightning-fast connectivity and minimal latency. The launch of 5G is much more beyond a generational shift; it ushers in a new period of opportunities for the IT sector. Based on the original objectives and expectations of both domains, the goal of this article is to develop a method that integrates AI with additive manufacturing systems.",

  "abstract": "Starting from the earlier civilisation till date, money plays a crucial part in the transfer of goods and services. With this digital world, the money also changes its faces from paper money to digital currency called cryptocurrency without any central bank, which runs on top of the technology called blockchain. The trendiest cryptocurrency is bitcoin. Forecasting the daily price is a challenging task due to its nonlinearity. Most of the researchers tried to predict using various statistical and machine learning models which were not satisfactory because of its large dataset with more noise. The intention is to design a deep learning multiplicative long short-term memory model to estimate the price of bitcoin with an attention mechanism using technical indicators which gives better accuracy and a very less error rate. The proposed model is compared with some existing models, say long short-term memory, peephole, gated recurrent unit and multiplicative long short-term memory on the presence and absence of technical indicators. The comparative result shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing models in terms of mean square error, root mean square error and mean absolute error when evaluated with two benchmark datasets.",

This research paper analyses the efficacy of e-portfolios to involve engineering students of BTech first year in setting, organising, comprehending, evaluating, and analysing academic writing skills through information and communication technology (ICT). The English language and communication skills lab uses a quantitative experimental research strategy that emphasises questionnaires and e-portfolios to improve participants' writing skills (ELCS). This project studies using JNTU-related e-portfolios to create intrinsically motivating creative competency in students. E-portfolios are easily accessible and allow students to provide multimedia proof, say the researchers. Instead of writing about their accomplishments, students can submit photographs, videos, and audio recordings. This speeds up and enhances learning. Many engineering students enhanced their persuasive writing using e-portfolios.",

For guaranteeing network security, this study proposes the Machine Learning-based Security Active Defence Model (MLSADM). Machine Learning (ML) is how artificial intelligence learns patterns that lead to abnormal behaviour. This occurs when an artificial intelligence system or neural network is deceived into imperfectly recognising or intentionally adapting the input. An emerging type of attack and a coordinated attack is measured in the attack and defence situation. Experiments have been carried out with the dynamic (learning) attacker of a static (fixed) defender, static attackers and active attackers. The findings show that the proposed model enhances network security with high accuracy in network abnormal behaviour detection compared to other popular methods.",

DLT enhances data immutability and transparency and offers new possibilities of interactions and business models to the new industrial networks, allowing a trustable horizontal and vertical data flow between different organisations. Although these possible improvements are in sight, the approach and characteristics that can make the technology suitable with the I4.0 paradigm, are not yet well-defined, and in some cases puzzling for industry managers. In this paper, possible applications, features of DLTs and its available types are reviewed and analysed, giving a clear definition of the most relevant characteristics that these technologies can offer to manufacturing industry.",

  "abstract": "Major innovations are about reducing transactions costs. This has been true since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and it continues along the inventive process in the last 220 years. The innovative technology of blockchains and cryptocurrencies with smart contracts (distributed digital technology) has a potential for substantial reduction of transactions costs that are rooted in human nature. Like earlier transformational innovative technologies, such as the steam locomotive and the internet, the new distributed digital technology may create disruptions in the market today, but if successful it will increase welfare by transforming the way that people transact in the market in the future. The major feature of the new digital technology is that it makes it possible for individuals to match their supply and demand without intervention of organisations like firms, financial intermediaries and regulating agencies. The new digital technology gets us closer to the neoclassical perfect market model. Distributed digital technology progresses in a step-by-step fashion. The first step was the Bitcoin: electronic peer-to-peer cash transfers without the need for central regulations. A number of services, particularly those that can be traded digitally, are next in line. Two potential applications of distributed digital applications are global trade in services and to MNEs.",

  "abstract": "This paper aims to explore the application of the Multi-Objective Model (MOM) in the logistics operation of an e-commerce platform. E-commerce is a new business model, and people are studying the use of various technologies to optimise its operation mode. On this basis, the logistics operation on the e-commerce platform is studied by using the method of moments based on deep learning, Fuzzy Differential Equations (FDEs) and the Internet of Things. On the ImageNet data set, the parameter initialisation of the network is trained and detected. The initial learning rate of the network is 0.0003, and 45,000 iterations are needed to reduce the learning rate. The convergence and stability of FDEs are of great significance for the accuracy of data on e-commerce platforms. The results show that the correlation between web page accessibility and revenue on the e-commerce platform is 0.011, and this data acquisition is based on traditional methods.",

The novelty is that through the structural design and research of the intelligent logistics system, the CNN is combined to construct a management system of supply chain logistics of image recognition and information processing.

  "abstract": "Multi-objective optimisation problem in Internet of Things technology has been widely concerned by researchers. The family of multi-objective particle swarm optimisation is among the most representative ones. However, there still exist the shortcomings of overspending and premature convergence. This paper proposes a many-objective particle swarm optimisation algorithm based on opposition-based mutation for elite mechanism. The new algorithm mainly includes three strategies: (1) Opposition-based learning population initialisation strategy, which is designed to avoid the blindness and uncertainty of initial population, and improves the distribution of population and accelerates speed of exploration. (2) Multi-elite opposition mutation mechanism, which is proposed to help particles get away from local optimal positions via a targeted exploration in the search space. (3) Singularity archive technique, which is established to disturb the global evolution trend and further balance the contradiction of convergence and diversity of the population. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing 11 algorithms in the simulation experiments.",

First, a logistics scheduling platform based on the IoT is designed. The platform integrates photography, positioning, laser scanning, scheduling and other functions. Then, a real-time data transmission scheduling model and optimisation algorithm based on IoT, e-commerce and deep reinforcement learning are proposed. They can improve the efficiency of data scheduling and processing on the platform, and ensure data integrity. Finally, the model is tested and evaluated. The results show that the scheduling time of the designed model is controlled within 10 s. The model scheduling data integrity rate is 91% on average. The Long Short-Term Memory model's prediction accuracy is higher than that of other models. The optimisation algorithm designed can significantly reduce the cost and time of IoT edge computing.

  "abstract": "For multi-objective optimisation problems, a balance between convergence and diversity in multi-objective particle swarm algorithms is the key to approach real Pareto fronts with well-distributed. In order to obtain the Pareto optimal set with good distribution, a multi-objective particle swarm optimisation algorithm based on Levy mutation and information entropy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an entropy adaptive strategy is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation ability of the swarm, which guides the flight direction of particles via the adaptively adjusting parameters with information entropy of the swarm. Secondly, a Levy mutation operator is proposed to ensure that the algorithm has the ability to jump out of the local solution. The new mutation operator can control the magnitude of particle mutation by random steps, so that the mutation is more anisotropic and diverse, thus ensuring that the particles still have a large global exploration ability in the late iteration as well as increasing the local exploitation accuracy. Finally, the experimental results in benchmark test functions show that the proposed algorithm has better exploration ability than several compared algorithms and can approach real Pareto front with better distribution.",

  "abstract": "Electronic medical data management is eased with the integration of communication technologies and the cloud/Internet of Things (IoT) platform in recent years. The organisation and mining of the data from massive repositories is a complex and time-consuming process. However, the exploitation of such massive information requires large-scale analytical procedures by accounting its significance. This article introduces Congruent Fine-grained Data Mining (CFDM) model for reducing the complexities in large-scale medical data handling. This model identifies the independent and relation-based repositories for matching the request queries in the data retrieval process. By using a classification decision-tree, the identifications are performed to improve the retrieval rate. In this classification tree, the independent and relation-based data are first analysed for their matching consistencies. By pursuing this process, the non-matching query-data satisfying the relevance condition are grouped into a new relationship based classification. This helps to improve the matching and retrieval rate preciously in the consecutive mining instances. The proposed model improves retrieval responses, retrieving time, complexity and data availability.",

Then, a process of encryption is initiated using SDES algorithm; the encryption time taken was 0.003 seconds and this encrypted file is uploaded into Dropbox. Before uploading the file into Dropbox, an auto resource allocation process is initiated, cloud service provider can able to decide whether the data provider file is approved or rejected.

The IoT-data requires utilisation of Dimensionality Reduction (DR) and classification techniques. An advanced Data Aggregation (DA) technique decreases the number of total data transmissions and facilitates data accuracy. Here, a data analysis framework is suggested for DA and Outlier Detection (OD) by employing a modified K-Nearest Neighbour (M-KNN) algorithm. Further, the recovery error rate as well as Energy Consumption (EC) of proposed methodology is analysed and compared with the existing Recursive Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA) technique. The techniques are compared by varying the cluster size and the results depict that the proposed M-KNN attains the lowest relative error and lowest EC for variable number of cluster size for both Intel and NDBC-TAO data. The proposed model is crucial for exploring the sensor data and predicting future events based on observed sensor data analysis.",

  "abstract": "In today's era users had become more uphill and expect to run compute-intensive apps in their smartphone devices. Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) thus combines mobile computing and Cloud Computing (CC) in order to use offloading techniques to expand mobile computer capabilities. Computer offloading solves Smart Mobile Devices (SMD) limitations such as limited computing power, limited battery life and limited storage space by distributing output and workload to other rich systems with enhanced efficiency and resources. For data modelling and analysis, scientific research also needs a large amount of computing power. This paper explains about the donation of processing power from unused smartphone computing power to the mobiles that need to download projects of medicine, astronomy, geology and physics through mobile web services. This is accomplished by developing a cellular gadget called 'Power Save' that download and coordinate the projects to be downloaded during the dormant condition of the mobile. Once the project is downloaded, the status of project server is changed and a new task is assigned.

  "abstract": "In today's phase of growing technology Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) are all over the places. It is a thriving segment in machine learning and Artificial Intelligences (AI) techniques. CNN needs bulk amount of computing competence and memory with higher frequency range. In this present investigation, Pre-Accumulator and Post-Multipliers (PAPM) are proposed which accelerate the speed of processor. 4-bit multiplier using Carry Save Adder (CSA) is built with 6Transistors-Adder and sutras of Vedic mathematics is constructed. Accumulator of multiplier and accumulator are designed with Two Level Edge Triggering Flip-Flops (TLET-FF) to increase bandwidth of the memory. The proposed architecture of Multiply Accumulate (MAC) circuit consumes very less power when compared to existing high speed MACs. Performance of accumulator is contrasted with three different, two-level triggered flip-flops namely 16TLET-FF, 14TLET-FF and 12TLET-FFs. The projected MAC replaces the existing multipliers due its low power together with high frequency of operation.",

  "abstract": "The importance of digital media has been increased in this pandemic; the media's security is a huge issue and this led to the development of cryptographic techniques that are secure and fast. Chaos-based image encryption has gained popularity due to its ergodic properties. This paper proposes a 1-dimensional chaotic logistic map cryptography based on superior iterations. Both the real and imaginary parts of the 1-dimensional map are used to generate the chaotic sequence. This chaotic sequence is further mixed with the key. The new sequence is used for scrambling and diffusion of pixel values of an image. The proposed scheme was evaluated using many measures like NPCR, UACI, MSE, PSNR and entropy. The simulation result shows that the cipher image's correlation coefficient is below 0.01. The entropy of the cypher picture is similar to its optimal value of eight; thus, the proposed technique is immune to statistical attack. The demonstrated result of NPCR and UACI shows that the proposed scheme is reliable and robust to differential crypto-analysis attacks. Gaussian and salt and pepper noise are added to the picture, the results show that the proposed scheme is resistant to occlusion attacks.",

  "abstract": "Data gathering using mobile sinks introduces new challenges to wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. Most of the approaches use single mobile sink or data collector which may not cover the entire network in time. The SenCars with multiple antennas select the optimum pair of sensor nodes to gather data simultaneously. In this paper, a priority based SenCar deployment strategy (PSDS) for mobile sink data gathering is proposed. In this scheme, the priority of sensed data determined depending on the urgency and deadline of data. Then one SenCar is deployed for collecting high priority (critical data) by directly visiting to the respective sensors. Another SenCar is deployed for collecting the low priority (non-critical data) from other sensors. Simulation results have shown that the proposed PSDS scheme achieves better PDR and higher residual energy with minimum data gathering delay.",

  "abstract": "The routing protocol for low power and lossy network (RPL) has tremendous scope in IoT, due to the fact that it can be customised as per network's domain requirement by altering objective function (OF). Many studies have proven that the careful crafting of OF with different metrics improve the quality of route identified by RPL. As the complexity of OF increases due to different metric combinations, the performance of RPL will start to deteriorate. We divide OF into a two-stage process to solve this problem. In the first stage we keep a simple OF that considers ETX and path delay and rank parents as per RPL specification. A fixed number of best ranked parents from the first stage OF are considered for further processing in the second stage OF. Fuzzy-based second stage OF considers mobility history, queue availability and remaining energy of the parents to select the preferred route. Second stage OF is run only on limited number of parents which improves performance of RPL. Performance evaluation shows that our two-stage objective function (TS-OF) reduces packet loss by 28% and energy consumption by 34% compared to the state of the art RPL objective function.",

The main reason lies in that the customer information is stored and displayed in plaintext during the e-commerce process. We present a customer privacy protection platform on the basis of the analysis, where such technical measures as information segmentation, data encryption and access authorisation are taken. With the customer privacy protection platform, the customer information is not stored and displayed in plaintext any more, which is replaced with two-dimensional code or barcode. The traceability helps to prevent the leakage and abuse of the consumer information as much as possible. Thus, the traditional operation process of e-commerce is then reengineered and the customer information is only used on demand.",

Admittedly, several articles have been devoted in the past to logistics service providers and transport companies, but without always relying on the contributions of service management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on SCM and its application in service companies. The issue is to determine whether there is a consensus on its definition, its aspects discussed and the methodologies chosen. The review of 53 articles shows that SCM definitions and approaches differ from one study to another. Many studies have examined the performance of the SCM, either globally, or partially, but again, it is difficult to compare them given the multiplicity of approaches used.",

The existing capital raising methods are less transparent, have limited depth of funding and less diversification. Utilising a cryptocurrency smart contract-based early stage funding platform will allow new ventures to obtain a staged funding environment, starting from seed funding. Each stage of funding can be represented by a smart contract that is aligned to a formal standardised legally binding contract between the venture and investors through the platform. Competition for funds and a transparent smart contract-based platform should allow free markets to price investments in the new venture in a more efficient fashion. Additionally, such a platform should provide more funding opportunities to new ventures that weren't available prior.",

Still, it is essential to researchers in business and information management, given the intense focus on improving efficiency and profitability in the future. In the last few years, some of the main information management applications and events that have increased the complexity of information technology processes include the mining of cryptocurrencies. With the growth of new business transactions using cryptocurrencies and the enormous number of algorithms used by miners to mine cryptocurrencies, the complexity of processes and network congestion has become a factor to consider in the future.

Here, the combination of two fingerprints is given as input for generating virtual identity. Moreover, the fingerprints are given as input to the enrolment phase. From one fingerprint, minutiae positions are obtained and from another one, orientation is obtained. The extracted information is further used to generate the combined minutiae template. Then, the SNL is applied which comprises certain strategies like intermixing, swapping, and simulated values insertion for providing a new virtual identity. Meanwhile, the authentication phase is implemented wherein the model needs two queries as fingerprints for confirmation. The proposed SNL-based cancellable biometric technique shows superior performance having maximal accuracy of 91.332%, minimal FAR of 5.434%, minimal FRR of 3.504%, and maximal GAR of 94.565%.",

  "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) provides an exciting future for the interaction of devices utilising computing and sensorial capabilities. Among the existing technologies, fifth generation (5G) schemes are expected to be the motivating force for the realisation of IoT concept. This research paper reviews existing state-of-art on the secure communication for 5G and IoT networks. We have created a taxonomy and categorised the research works based on the protocols such as light weight authentication protocol, trust-aware routing protocol, service-oriented authentication protocol, and application-oriented protocol. The research gaps and the challenges faced for secure communication in 5G and IoT networks are listed for further enhancement in the security protocols. We further analysed the research work based on the classification methods, performance metrics, and the year of publication. Our analysis reveals that the most commonly used classification technique is trust-aware routing protocols, and the most frequently used performance metrics is execution time, the execution time of most of the research work lies between 10 ms to 300 ms, and the communication overhead ranges from 1 × 105 bits to 5 × 105 bits.",

The digital twin (DT) is another 6G technology that offers data analysis and prediction of the system resources. The current works on DT and MEC-empowered 6G networks investigate either an emerging or traditional application execution performance, not both. The existing works did not present any intelligent resource provisioning scheme for emerging and traditional application execution over DT and MEC-enhanced 6G networks. To minimise the application execution latencies, energy, and resource-usage fee for 6G applications, this paper develops user service requirements, timeslot sacrifice, and triple benefit-aware resource provisioning scheme with an innovative network, timing, and numerical model for DT and MEC-enhanced 6G networks by considering heterogeneous applications, resources, applications priority, and requirements. The results depict that 67% time gain, 54.53% payment and 10.35% energy gain are achieved in proposed scheme over the conventional method.",

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a substantial amendment to the existing Bitcoin consensus by using the wasted computation to adjust the difficulty of each miner that provided computation effort overtime. Therefore, any time a miner justifies its work toward the consensus and hence the network, without reaching the solution, then its difficulty will decrease accordingly for the next blocks. The impact of this adjustment is three-fold: 1) it allows to 'recycle' part of the energy previously spent in the computation of a previous block, which makes the system less energy consuming as a whole; 2) it also reduces the calculation time of a block and thus speeds up the validation of transactions; 3) it increases the loyalty of the actors by favouring the old miners who have been investing in the system for a long time, compared to a new entrant with a high computing power, who would monopolise all the rewards otherwise.",

  "abstract": "Computer applications are transitioning from centralised to decentralised automation in the modern industrial era. The consensus algorithm is a critical component in decentralised applications. Wait-free consensus is an unresolved issue in asynchronous systems. Deterministic protocols are known to be incapable of solving the wait-free consensus problem. Wait-free consensus protocol implementation occurs when all processors complete their predefined steps regardless of the execution speed of the other processors. Many randomised algorithms for wait-free consensus have been proposed, but no deterministic algorithm is possible. In this paper, we present a survey of wait-free consensus algorithms that have been studied and are currently being used in some well-known applications. There is also discussion of open issues and challenges in deploying various consensus mechanisms. This survey will provide a detailed understanding of the wait-free consensus protocol and will aid in the direction of research in the field of designing consensus algorithms.",

  "abstract": "In recent years, in order to protect the security of medical privacy data, a large number of telemedicine authentication protocols have been proposed. Some protocols use digital signature methods to achieve two-way authentication among patients, doctors and medical servers, so the execution efficiency of protocol is low. Some protocols fail to achieve patient identity anonymity, the true identity of patient can be analysed by the doctor, so it can't resist security attacks. In order to solve the above problems, a more secure telemedicine authentication protocol is proposed in this paper, which implements two-way identity authentication in the telemedicine authentication model using SHA-1 hash function, time stamp and random number operations. In addition, the introduction of temporary identity can achieve patient identity anonymity and personal medical data security. The protocol has better performance in terms of security, storage and computing overhead, it is more suitable for telemedicine authentication system.",

The inefficiency in SC is due to poor information sharing and lack of coordination among different echelons of SC, which causes the bullwhip effect. To eliminate the aforementioned problem, the concept of block chain is introduced. This research aims to evolve a methodology which can give insight for maintaining high performance SC through technique of block chain, a decentralised platform, accessible to each member of SC. The findings of this study suggest that the block chain is a modern, applicable and sustainable technique which can improve performance measures of SC by making information sharing better and instant and can eradicate the reasons of the bullwhip effect. Finally, in the end, demerits of the block chain in the context of SC are also discussed.",

This paper considers the inventory management of a supply chain that involves multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distributers. The data management is done by the block chain technology, where each distributer holds a hash function to store its data, which cannot be restored by the other distributers. The proposed model intends to reduce the multi-objective inventory cost involving transaction cost, inventory holding cost, shortage cost, transportation cost, and time cost. The hybridisation of two meta-heuristic algorithms like spider monkey optimisation (SMO) and sea lion optimisation (SLnO) termed as spider monkey local leader-based sea lion optimisation algorithm (SMLL-SLnO) is used to improve the inventory management model. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed optimisation model are validated by comparing over the other traditional models.",

The FinTech environment is changing rapidly and requires constant review of the ecosystem of financial technology innovations to keep abreast of the innovations. This study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the payment and money transfer segment of FinTech innovations in Africa using a multiple case study methodology from Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. We pulled information from multiple sources, including semi-structured interviews, archival data in the form of industry and regulatory reports, and observational field notes. The results highlight how regulatory innovation (Kenya) better enables the success of new technologies and their concomitant behavioural change than bank-led (South Africa) and pre-emptive (Nigeria) regulatory styles. This study will help FinTech innovators, academics, and policymakers to understand how technology and framework conditions impact payment business models in Africa.",

  "abstract": "The software-defined space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is regarded as future-generation networking solution due to its wide-area coverage and seamless communication support for ground networks and resource-intensive application support for space-air networks. The SDN-based literary works are restricted only to resource management for space-air or ground networks, not both. The resource scheduling for multi-users caching, computing and data-transfer task accomplishment over software-defined SAGIN were out of their investigations by taking proactive local SDN, heterogenous users and applications, SLA requirements, priority, latency, and users' budget into account. To outperform the problems, this paper advocates a proactive SDN-based resource management scheme considering SLA requirements, latency, priority, and users' budget for multi-user task completion over software-defined SAGIN. This paper contributes an analytical model that covers task completion time, energy expenditure, financial cost, and SLA fulfilment metrics. The performance results illustrate that proposed scheme produces 72% time and 69% financial gain over the compared scheme.",

  "abstract": "Edge computing has become an important innovative business model in the 5G era, especially its low latency feature, which is considered to be not available in traditional solutions. Therefore, edge computing can provide more service capabilities and has a wider range of application scenarios. However, the collaboration of computing power between edge computing and cloud computing in the central position has become a new technical problem. That is, it is necessary to achieve cloud-to-network collaboration, cloud-to-edge collaboration, or even edge-to-edge collaboration among edge computing, cloud computing, and network to achieve the optimisation of resource utilisation. On the basis of studying the compute distribution and scheduling requirements of edge computing, this paper introduces a compute network scheme based on the deep fusion of cloud, edge and network, called compute first networking (CFN). Firstly, we introduce the basic concept and related work of CFN. Then, we mainly discuss the framework and key technology of CFN. After that, we present some applications with respect to CFN. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the area of compute first networking.",

  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of the industrial revolution 4.0, the recent fuel price crisis, and the vision of the Sultanate of Oman logistics strategy 2040 are forcing the Omani logistics sector to determine its capability in handling these four issues simultaneously. This study proposes a decision-making model for small and medium logistics enterprises in Oman for analysing numerous potential business strategies by considering the uncertainty of contemporary factors. A hybrid of multiple-criteria decision-making methods, namely, the analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy link-based approach and evidential reasoning approach, were used in this study. It was found that the 'centralised business activities' business strategy is preferable and more essential to be implemented immediately, mainly due to the geographical market positioning reason. This novel study contributes to developing the decision model for the Logistics Enterprises in Oman as a new measurement when dealing with the uncertainty of external factors of the business environment.",

  "abstract": "Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies have been increasingly spoken and have become a global phenomenon known. Their high volatility and lack of regulation makes these investments very risky, and even though these coins are often associated with criminal activities, an increase on the number of investors is visible every day. Most of the published studies explain the technology behind cryptocurrencies, however, there was no published study that aims to understand what kind of profile these investors have and what are their motivations or expectations. Based on a questionnaires and interviews presented to the investors, this study concluded that there are two separate investor profiles and also understood what are their motivations and expectations for the future. It was also possible to see what vision regulators, private equities and corporate banking have for this new type of currency and if they consider them as a valid mean of payment.",

The paper describes a review of 88 refereed academic papers on the subject of FinTech published in journals that have high SJR2017 scores. Papers were categorised according to the type of companies leveraging FinTech (existing financial institutions vs. new entrants) and the type of value derived from FinTech innovation (new value-added vs. improved efficiency). Also considered were types of new value-added, geographical focus of the research and research methodologies. The largest number of studies concerned the use of FinTech innovation by new entrants to offer solutions to social issues or build new financial ecosystems. Over half the studies were on FinTech in Asia or the European Union, and the most common methodology employed was the case study.",

  "abstract": "Typically, cellular internet of things (IoT) devices are spread over very large areas, usually countrywide or even worldwide. This makes the firmware update operation a troublesome and costly task, and it is usually avoided as long as possible. However, due to some bugs detected in the core software and/or some significant performance enhancements developed after the release of the device, the need for a firmware update becomes inevitable. We propose a new methodology in order to fulfil the firmware update remotely in an easy and secure way for especially the devices with quite limited resources, such as very small RAM and low processing power. We utilise multimedia messaging service (MMS) functions, and send the firmware to the remote cellular IoT devices as encrypted attachment. The preparation steps of the attachment are explained in detail, a handshaking mechanism is established and all are tested on a particular hardware. Some important remarks are also provided, so that major practical aspects of the methodology would be readily available in implementing it on hardware/software architectures of new IoT devices.",

As such, in this study an extensive literature review is conducted with the objective of introducing and explaining P2P systems, and a review of existing projects is made to show the benefits these systems may have. Also, a survey is conducted to understand how several factors influence the implementation value of P2P systems, and the results obtained show a strong interest in these projects. Finally, conclusions are drawn concerning the high value of P2P systems and show how this energy trading model may be the future of energy distribution management.",

  "abstract": "The increasing interest in digital currencies, their exceptional price rise, and the continuous discussions about their benefits raise the question: to what extent can it be an alternative to the traditional currencies in the future? It has become a prominent topic of discussion among several investments and market stakeholders seeking to enhance the growth of their wealth. This paper aims to bring answers to the nature of relationships between four major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple), and the stock market return (S&P500). This study applies the wavelet method to daily data from 1 June 2017 to 15 November 2021, in COVID-19 sanitary crisis time. According to the results, this study shows a positive co-movement in the medium and long run between the four studied cryptocurrencies and S&P500 during different periods, especially in times of uncertainty. These findings have practical implications as they can be used strategically to make optimal investment decisions and build portfolio diversification strategies with the conventional financial market asset.",

  "abstract": "Detecting and predicting trending topics from steaming social data has always been the point of active research area in business and research firms to take quick decisions, change marketing strategies and set new goals. Topic modelling is one of the excellent methods to analyse the contents from large collection of documents in an unsupervised manner and it is a popular method used in natural language processing, information retrieval, text processing and many other research domains. In this paper, deep learning-based topic modelling technique has been proposed to detect and predict the trending topics from streaming data. The online version of latent semantic analysis with regularisation constraints has been designed using long short-term memory network. Specifically, a problem of detecting the topics from streaming media is handled as the minimisation of quadratic loss function constrained by ℓ1 and ℓ2 regularisation. The online learning mechanism supports scalable topic modelling. For topic prediction, sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory network has been designed. Experimentally, significant results have been achieved in terms of query retrieval performance and topic relevance metrics for topic detection on our published dataset. For topic prediction, the results obtained in terms of root mean squared error are also significant.",

  "abstract": "Fintech developments in Malaysia are contributing to the formation of know-how, experience and technology expertise that can be of significant fundamental growth towards technology related industries in Malaysia. The objective of this literature revision is to systematically review the number of studies on the phenomenon of Fintech in the Malaysian financial services sector from 2014 to 2019 to identify the primary subject studied, journals involved, method employed and discover the gap in the current body of knowledge which justifies future research directions to provide an extensive knowledge contribution to researchers and economists. This paper consists of an analysis of studies dedicated to different types of articles on Malaysian Fintech. The study proposes a future research direction, which may stimulate more intensive research in this phenomenon's field. To the best of author's knowledge there is no systematic literature review on this topic that has been published in academic journals.",

  "abstract": "The study measures the risk level linked with different portfolios of cryptocurrencies by using portfolio diversification techniques. Data on prices and trade volumes of cryptocurrencies were collected on a daily basis, from 2012 till 2018. Ten portfolios were constructed based on diverse types and numbers of cryptocurrencies. The results of the study confirm a negative relationship between the average number of cryptocurrencies and the average risk level of the portfolio. Involving more cryptocurrencies within the portfolio reduces the diversification risk of the portfolio. The average volatility and average correlation coefficient both drop when moving towards portfolios with more cryptocurrencies. Average returns stand against portfolio theories, where more risky portfolios offer less daily weighted average returns and the other way around. Outcomes of the study provide indications for the individual investors and financial institutions on the risk characteristic attached to the portfolio of cryptocurrencies.",

  "abstract": "In the era of digital revolution many contemporary events that changed the world were shaped through the internet. Nowadays, the emergence of internet of things (IoT), combining physical objects with virtual networks is expected to have even more influence. This new 'decentralised' structure in the world raises questions such as power, governance and the notion of democracy online. The aim of this paper is to investigate these notions. We have taken the examples of Bitcoin and Wikipedia and examined their decision-making process. Our analysis has found some inconsistencies in their policies, that are in contradiction with democracy and consensus principles of governance. Starting from our findings, we present further improvements that can be used to achieve more democracy and equity in the digital context.",

  "abstract": "Transparent supply chains have slowly gained prominence because of their utility in resolving sustainability concerns and improving operational efficiency and decision making. It requires companies to know more about their upstream chain and communicate it to their internal and external stakeholders. This in turn helps build resilience into the supply chains, making response quicker in the face of disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite both the necessity and obligation, companies are struggling with implementing a transparent supply chain because of unclear reasons. In this paper, we identify and model those barriers in implementing transparent supply chains. Results suggest that customer privacy drives other barriers in the system and hence should be given adequate importance while forming the data pipeline for transparent supply chains. Vague short-term ROI, low technology adoption, and underdeveloped infrastructure also emerged as critical barriers that managers should carefully mitigate while implementing transparency in supply chains.",

  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of volatility spillover from Bitcoin as the largest digital currency on selected digital currencies. Volatility spillovers are a warning for risk management among cryptocurrencies and are especially instructive during periods of crisis. We investigate the effects of volatility spillover between digital currencies through the conditional covariance matrix. The findings show that Bitcoin had the highest volatility spillover on Dogecoin, Dash, and Ripple among digital currencies, respectively, and had the lowest volatility spillover on Ethereum. Bitcoin is used more as an asset than a currency and the Bitcoin market is more volatile than other currencies and prone to potential price bubbles. Based on the results, the bubbles in the digital currency market show that the market is irrational and due to the speculative behaviour of investors and the excitement of the Bitcoin market, it is causing economic instability.",

  "abstract": "This research aims to study whether zakat is due on cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) and to address the issues related to imposing zakat upon it. This study is conducted based on the qualitative research method following the inductive method and explanatory research approach. The findings show that Bitcoin is recognised as a digital asset in many countries and the tax is imposed accordingly. As such, Bitcoin is among the zakatable assets since it meets the conditions of zakat on assets. Moreover, Bitcoin as a digital currency would also be zakatable if a country recognises it as currency, as would any regulated digital currency issued by a government. Imposing zakat on Bitcoin would boost the total amount of zakat collectible, which would be beneficial for needy people. Further research is recommended to provide the zakat model for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",

  "abstract": "In the 21st century, digital currencies have become a disruptive technology that is shaking up both financial markets and academic environment. Investors, politicians, companies, and academics are attempting to improve their understanding of these currencies for future investment possibilities and technological applications. This study aims to evaluate changes in different volatility states of eight digital currencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XMR, NEM, LISK, and STEEM) that showed the highest liquidity and market capitalisation from 2013 to 2017. The methodology involved the MSGARCH model, using SGARCH, EGARCH, GJRGARCH, and TGARCH models. Our study demonstrated that two volatility regimes, that is, one with a larger volatility and another with a smaller one, clearly exist for all the analysed cryptocurrencies. What differs between the currencies is the probability of a second regime occurring. Moreover, we concluded that for both the first and second state, the asymmetry coefficient (gamma) is positive for all currencies.",

To support the flexibility and speed demanded by the market, technologies emerge in the context of Industry 4.0 (I4) and consequently, in Supply Chain 4.0 (SC4). Considering the literature on SC4, gaps can be found as no current research exhibits the representativeness of each technology or that has listed the I4 technologies applied in the supply chain (SC). Therefore, the goal of this study is to map the state of the art of I4 technologies applied to SC, using as methodology a systematic literature review (SLR). As a result, this article elaborates on the state of the art of SC4, lists and discusses the technologies covered, shows which countries are studying this topic, and presents how these technologies are being applied to SC.",

  "abstract": "Financial innovations are taking place around the world in the form of widespread storms and one of such major innovations is cryptocurrency, introduced in 2008. It has the properties of both a currency (medium of exchange) and an asset (stored value). Hence it can be used as a payment method as well as portfolio investment option. Seeking the importance of cryptocurrency, the present study aims to explore its adoption worldwide. Based upon the use of secondary data, Google Trend time series, Google Trend country interest points, Bitcoin nodes network and software download trend of the countries are taken as proxies for analysing the awareness and adoption of cryptocurrency around the world. The result of the study provides that the cryptocurrency market is highly searched and adopted in developed countries than in developing countries. Some countries have restricted or put an implicit restriction on the use of cryptocurrency, but on the other hand, many tech-savvy countries such as the USA, Canada, Ukraine, and the European Union have welcomed this new technology with open arms.",

  "abstract": "Crypto currencies research is seen as young field though has made drastic impact with the introduction of Bitcoin. In order to strengthen the relatively young multidisciplinary field, there is a need to conduct review of literature. Therefore, it is deemed opportune to carry out systematic literature review which could unveil gaps for future studies and also inform policy makers in preparation towards adoption of cryptocurrencies. About 22 articles were filtered from sampled 42 articles after critically examining them on basis of contribution of insights drawn for discussion based on the model adopted for thematic analysis. The four-step life cycle model comprise of: needs assessment, design, adoption issues and impact assessment. Alternative coins have emerged which calls for comparative analysis and review to explore its usage. User perception of the crypto markets and the likelihood of governments deploring its use are areas considerable of further studies.",

  "abstract": "To ensure the integrity and reliability of the data on cloud servers, many public data verification schemes have been presented to allow data auditors to remotely audit the data integrity without fetching the data back. Recently, Zhao et al. (2021) proposed a dynamic data integrity audition scheme for cloud computing based on the dynamic array multi-branch tree (MBT). In their scheme, each leaf node x stores a hash value H(x) which relates to all the hash values of blocks in its block array. Because the value H(x) is always used to generate the integrity proof when any block linked to x is challenged, the attacker can deceive the auditor by replacing the challenged block with another one in the same block array. To address this problem of Zhao's scheme, we add a new index i for each block in the block array, which can ensure the uniqueness of each block to resist the replacement attack. Moreover, the algorithms of label generation and proof verification in Zhao's scheme are also upgraded to keep the soundness of the scheme. We give the security proof of the new scheme and make comprehensive performance analyses showing that compared with the original algorithms in Zhao's scheme, only negligible costs such as hash are brought to the new ones.",

  "abstract": "This research investigates the impact of digital technology, via Fin-Tech challenger banks on banks' business models. Fin-Techs are exerting a pervasively disruptive influence on bank business models. Notwithstanding the obvious benefits, analysis in this area from high-income transition economy remains unexplored. The paper exploits this gap via a drop/pick-up survey questionnaire administered on a sample of all 68 UAE-Federation of Bank members. The results indicate that digital technology is transforming the banking ecosystem from classical competitive models to innovative bank-to-Fin-Tech collaborative models, where classical banking is disintermediated into multi-modal, multi-directional and smaller models, generating opportunities never seen before, more so for overseas banks from developed economies. The sample period is short if we consider the frenetic pace of technological change, which may compromise the extension of the results to a wider population. The paper contributes to research on bank models by providing insights on how classical bank models are being transformed.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing promises various advantages compared to classical provisioning models and is therefore highly interesting for e-government services. For security and data protection reasons, adoption of cloud computing in public sectors has focused on private or community clouds so far, underusing the great potential of public clouds. In this article, we tackle this issue and show opportunities to unleash the full potential of public clouds also to the public sector. First, we perform a thorough literature survey to identify a comprehensive set of requirements for e-government services in public cloud environments. Then, we assess cloud-related technologies and propose strategies to satisfy these identified requirements, providing decision makers from the public sector a comprehensive overview that helps during design, migration, and development of e-government service to be deployed in public clouds.",

  "abstract": "Patient health record information management becomes an important and challenging task through the different practices followed by hospitals. Also, the risks associated with securing the data from cyber-attacks and data breaches become inevitable. Ransomware is the biggest cyber-attack in the history of National Health Service (NHS) which has affected nearly 100 countries worldwide in 2017. In the healthcare system, loss of sensitive data leads to embarrassment whereas loss of integrity leads to loss of the patient's life. Though many technical solutions exist to store the electronic health record (EHR) information in a secure way, it is not sufficient to satisfy the security requirements such as clear attributes for role-based access, common regulations that protect patient's privacy and specific guidelines to control the data. This paper provides a brief discussion on the existing security mechanisms with a proposal based on the temporal shadow in the cloud. The integrity of the patient's document is modelled with linked records and verified by temporal signature.",

  "abstract": "Crowdsensing is a new paradigm for data collection in the internet of things environment, in which the data aspirant outsource sensing tasks to sensing devices such as smart mobile phones through a crowdsensing server (CSS). Despite its numerous advantages, the vulnerability of sensitive data disclosure in crowdsensing generates a severe obstacle against its participants and restricts its use in privacy-sensitive domains. The semi-honest CSS tries to learn sensitive information such as the identity, and attributes of both the data requester and data collectors. Also, the malicious data collector nodes who are unable to execute the data collection task will make an effort to learn the task description and thereby infer the data being collected. We propose a privacy-preserving cost-effective work distribution system with a fine-grained access control (PPA) scheme. A ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) method with hidden access policy is used to choose data collectors and safeguard both the data requester and data collector's privacy.",

To analyse and understand these challenges, we designed a performance evaluation benchmark which integrates Cloud, Fog, Edge and Serverless computing to conduct a comparative study for IoT-based healthcare application. It gives the platform for the developers to design IoT applications based on user guidelines to run various applications concurrently on different paradigms. Furthermore, we used recent machine learning techniques for the optimisation of resources, energy, cost and overheads to identify the best technique based on important Quality of Service parameters. Experimental results show that serverless computing performs better than non-serverless in terms of energy, latency, bandwidth, response time and scalability by 3.8%, 3.2%, 4.3%, 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively.

  "abstract": "The ever-increasing computing power backed by Moore's law and the rapid breakthroughs in encryption has transformed the way currency is transferred and used. While the traditional government-controlled currency maintains its dominant position, a new virtual currency known as cryptocurrency has sprung up. It competes head-on by decentralizing the system, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions, and offering a universal exchange medium. However, the phase shift process is in its early stage, hindered by doubts in the mind of the public. In this paper, a comparison has been made between traditional, digital fiat and cryptocurrency, using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). It helped to ascertain the current level of awareness amongst the people of Pakistan and their likelihood of adopting the virtual currency. A forecasting approach along with a case study is also employed to see the future trends and security concerns revolving around the new medium.",

  "abstract": "Digital engineering, the digital transformation of engineering to leverage digital technologies, is coming globally. This paper explores digital systems engineering, which aims at developing theory, methods, models, and tools to support digital engineering practice. A critical task is to digitalise engineering artefacts, thus enabling information and model sharing, traceability, and accountability across platforms, across lifecycle, and across domains. We identify challenges and enabling digital technologies; analyse the transition from traditional engineering to digital engineering; define core concepts, including digitalisation, unique identification, digitalised artefacts, digital augmentation, and others; present a big picture of digital systems engineering in four levels: vision, strategy, action, and foundation; briefly discuss each of main areas of research. Digitalisation enables fast infusing and leveraging novel digital technologies; unique identification enables information traceability and accountability in lifecycle; provenance enables tracing dependency relations among engineering artefacts, supporting model reproducibility and replicability, and helping with trustworthiness evaluation of digital artefacts.",

  "abstract": "The growing world of digitisation has given rise to cybercrimes. Digital forensics is the process of collecting lawful evidence. Such evidence plays a very crucial role in the court of law to demonstrate the fact explicitly against the crime of the suspect. To ensure the admissibility of evidence in the court of law during trials, it is important to maintain evidence using a proper evidence management system. We propose the use of a unidirectional multi-hop proxy re-encryption scheme for authority delegation. This proposed system will help in securely delegating access to digital evidence. The re-encryption scheme perceives a clearer perception of security and validates the usefulness of proxy re-encryption as a method of adding access control to a secure evidence management system. The correctness analysis of the proposed scheme is validated by using BAN logic. The security analysis using the AVISPA tool shows that the proposed scheme is safe against various security attacks.",

  "abstract": "As consumers' trust and confidence in food have been shaken by food incidents that could be intentional (crime) or unintentional (negligence). This paper examines the issue of food integrity in a holistic approach that goes beyond food safety and food quality. The concept of farm-to-fork from supply chain management being adopted to review the extant literature concerning integrity of food supply chain. From the extensive literature review, food safety system such as HACCP is argued to be insufficient in assuring food integrity because it does not prevent deliberate contamination, while traceability and technology are recognised as important communication linkages that provide transparency and evidence on food integrity across the supply chain. This paper has developed the house of food integrity framework to provide novel insights on the food supply chain by illustrating food integrity as a multi-dimensional concept, which incorporates food defence in addition to food safety and food quality.",

This article examines Industry 4.0 and big data in Italy and the UAE. Very structurally different countries but similar in apprehending, this is the 'age of data' and already realised significant technological leaps on their own territories. Active intervention of government becomes crucial and central in the elaboration of industrial and technological policies towards the enhancement of a dynamic ecosystem and interactive environment where data can flow more smoothly along the production chain. In order to attain such systemic and organisational environment, governments create its solid foundation initially by fully utilising the architecture of big data internally. This paper addresses the current role of government and further actions needed as a stimulus, creator and originator of a cognitive and interactive environment for big data.",

  "abstract": "Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) is the simulation of digital signature algorithm (DSA) algorithm on elliptic curve. Compared with DSA, ECDSA has higher security and is the only widely accepted ECDSA, which has been adopted by many standardisation organisations. Based on the study of the original ECDSA scheme, this paper attempts to propose a new improved scheme. The proposed scheme has one main improvement. That is, considering that the original scheme has a finite field inversion process in the signature equation, the time-consuming inversion operation is completely avoided in the design. The proposed scheme has faster computation speed and reduces the ratio of verifying signature to signature generation time. The algorithm has certain significance for improving the efficiency of elliptic curve cryptography. Our simulation results show that the scheme runs faster and has higher signature and verification efficiency than that of the original scheme without compromising security. What's more, we also explore its application in bitcoin and Internet of Things (IoT).",

  "abstract": "With the progressive and continuous development in micro-electro-mechanical technologies, intelligent internet of things (IoT), and the propagation of 5G communication technology, the security of resource-controlled IoT appliances like RFID-based TMIS applications has received predominant attention. Typically, wireless communication channel is utilised among tag, reader and back-end server, which is easily vulnerable to various intimidations such as spoofing, DoS, replay, and de-synchronisation. Therefore, the privacy and integrity of the communicated information cannot be guaranteed. Researchers proposed various symmetric and asymmetric encryptions, hash functions, key management, CRC, and ECC-based techniques for solving privacy and integrity issues of RFID authentication for TMIS systems. In the related work, we discussed up-to-date RFID-based authentication for TMIS systems. However, most do not solve formal, informal attacks; moreover, they suffer from communication and computational complexities. Thus, this manuscript describes an enhanced mutual authentication practice for RFID components with hash and random functions. We further demonstrate that the proposed scheme offers all the desired security requirements by verifying AVISPA, Scyther, and GNY logic.",

  "abstract": "In this age of circular economy, amid rising social and environmental concerns, companies and customers are increasingly aware of eco-friendly supply chain implementation. The study aims to investigate twofold perceptions (customers' and employees') regarding the effect of green supply chain management (GSCM) on customer satisfaction (CS) through product quality, service quality, and product-service cost. A survey was conducted with structured questionnaires encompassing 509 valid participants (398 customers and 111 employees). This study provides two key findings using structural equation modelling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). First, according to customers' perception, GSCM does not have a direct impact on CS; it has a positive and statistically significant impact (indirect) on CS when product quality (PQ), service quality (SQ), and product-service cost (PSC) are there as mediators. Second, as per employees' perception, GSCM does not directly affect customer satisfaction; however, a positive and statistically significant indirect relationship exists where only PQ and PSC mediate the relationship. The findings bridge gaps in green supply chain literature, demonstrating how, from an environmental aspect, taking care of product quality, service quality, and cost results in increased customer satisfaction and provides invaluable contributions to understanding green supply chain behaviour.",

This paper is a comprehensive attempt to provide state of art survey of available centralised and distributed authentication scheme until 2020. The comparison has been carried out in terms of various factors network model, type of architecture, application domain and IoT layers. Based on the finding, it can be observed that 'IoT architecture' and 'how the authentication is performed' criterion can play an important role for deciding the authentication scheme. This paper provides summary of wide range of authentication schemes with the help of showing their strengths and limitations. The paper introduced a conceptualisation process of authentication for IoT, which constitutes a footstep for researchers working under different application domain.",

Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed some success and 'bitcoin' is now the largest cryptocurrency, with the total number of bitcoins currently valued at approximately 70 billion US dollars. However, globally there are economies which favour the bitcoin and some have banned the same. While many day traders have cash out their funds, veteran traders remain unfazed. In this scenario, it is essential to look into their price behaviour which reveals that there is huge a fluctuation, i.e., highly volatile in nature. Henceforth, their relationships with the trading volume, money supply, lag prices which influences the trade in bitcoin are measured using the ANN model revealing highly significant relationship.",

Identifying suspicious nodes in the bitcoin network is similar to the problem of recognising the origins in the contact network of different applications, i.e., virus propagation, rumour source in social networks, and poison spread in water networks. In order to investigate money laundering in bitcoin, we proposed an automated method to identify suspicious addresses in the bitcoin address graph. We chose two centrality measures to be calculated on the graph. The measures are betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. The nodes with the highest values for the measurements are suspicious. The accuracy of the proposed method is further investigated by comparing the fraudulent candidate nodes with other scenarios. It is shown that the identified nodes are correct candidates for further investigations.",

  "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are a highly debated subject in the US framework. The issues discussed will be accounting for cryptocurrencies in the USA and with a concentration on corporations. These problems involve government entities, market volatility, accounting methods, financial statement implications, public opinions, initial coin offers (ICOs), among others. Specifically, the topic of how to classify cryptocurrencies is discussed and the urge for decision-makers to make changes. Many opinions on the best way to classify cryptocurrencies exist. However, no official guidance concerning cryptocurrencies has been established. Cryptocurrencies are currently being treated in different ways in the accounting, financial, and tax worlds, which needs to be confronted. Additionally, the topic of cryptocurrency transactions' impact on financial statements, the valuation of cryptocurrencies, and the taxation of cryptocurrencies are evaluated. Furthermore, the topics of how different accounting and tax treatments of cryptocurrencies will impact the financial statements if the rules were to change.",

The study also suggests how P2P lending platform (mainly a debt-based platform) can follow sharia principles and can satisfy the needs of customers who believe in lending/borrowing as per Islamic finance. The study proposes an Islamic Fintech model for person to business (P2P) lending suitable for the small and medium enterprises. It is high time that new methods of credit should be introduced and promoted to give a boost to the sector and save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Against such a backdrop, the present study identifies the gaps in lending system for the small and medium enterprises and proposes a machine learning-based Fintech model as per sharia compliance for attracting more lenders.",

This crisis has not shown any sign of abatement despite world-wide efforts to contain the spread of the virus with draconian measures such as extensive social distancing, travel restrictions, and lockdowns. An inherent difficulty in controlling this crisis has disrupted the entire global supply chain and consequently threatened our livelihood and freedom. Faced with this daunting crisis, many businesses regardless of their sizes desperately need a viable survival strategy. To fill such a need, this paper reinvents crisis management tools and develops a strategy map for mitigating the adverse impact of COVID-19 on global supply chain operations, while enhancing supply chain resilience in times of turbulence and uncertainty.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Security and Networks",
  "abstract": "The group key agreement protocol allows a group of participants to agree on a one time session key and use it to protect future group oriented communication across an insecure network. In literature, secret sharing schemes, bilinear pairings, and polynomials were commonly used to distribute group key related information to the group participants. However, all these schemes work only for a single group but not for multiple groups. Hence, we propose a multi-group key agreement protocol based on a secret sharing scheme in this paper. This scheme is relevant in scenarios where groups are the most elementary entities for communication as opposed to individuals. Any threshold t or more participants could reconstruct the secret in every group. If there are t - 1 or fewer participants in any group, the secret cannot be obtained in those particular groups. The correctness of the scheme and security analysis are discussed.",

  "abstract": "The uncertain environment because of the COVID-19 pandemic has immensely impacted the global supply chain, as several countries-imposed travel restrictions. In such a situation, the present study aims at investigating impacts of customer relationship management (CRM) competency, information technology (IT) competency, and contingency management on supply chain management (SCM). The present work examines how leadership support affects supply chain sustainability. From theories as well as from literature inputs, we have developed a conceptual model. Validation of the conceptual model was done using the PLS-SEM technique to analyse 311 responses from the different organisations in India. The study found that CRM competency, IT competency, and appropriate contingency management have significant impacts on supply chain sustainability during uncertain environments. The role of the moderator 'leadership support' also impacts sustainability in supply chain during such crisis.",

For this, the project of a mortar from the Brazilian army was used as a real-world case study. Based on an analysis of the relationship between the results of an evaluation performed with the Brazilian army and this work proposal, it has been determined that PLM software can be used to manage requirements in projects for the defence industry, with requirements writing serving as a means of guiding product development throughout the project's duration. As a result of this research, it has been shown that the reuse of requirements across complex defence projects is an important tool for increasing efficiency and monitoring project execution. Furthermore, it was highlighted that insufficient tracking is a major issue with reusing requirements in the military, which leads to project management inefficiencies.",

  "abstract": "Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency which attracts growing interest over recent years. Much research from different subjects emerged as bitcoin is a multidisciplinary product. Among all these studies, the interpretation of the drastic fluctuation of bitcoin price attracts a great attention. Many influence factors of bitcoin price were found. However, seldom research reveals the dependence structure between price and its influence factors. By selecting ten interpretable influence factors from the bitcoin network and using copula theory, we find that the bitcoin price has different correlation structures with its influence factors. These findings provide new insights into the behaviour of miners, users, and coins in the bitcoin system, thus leading to meaningful implications for policymakers, investors and risk managers dealing with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",

Meanwhile, digital technologies AI and IoT (A-I) have brought a revolutionary impact on human's life in general and on traditional industries such as manufacture and agriculture in particular. The purpose of this research is to showcase the mechanism of an A-I based collaborative business ecosystem (A-I CBE) through an in-depth case study of a Chinese agricultural science and technology company, Celefish. We demonstrate how Celefish has developed the A-I CBE, leading the value co-creative collaboration between the ecosystem participants. Research suggests that the A-I CBE contributes to evolution and sustainable development of the fish farming ecosystem. The research adds contributions to the business ecosystem theory particularly in value co-creation and sustainability via digital technologies. It also provides practical implications for policymakers and strategic management in applying digital technologies.",

  "abstract": "With the rise of advanced internet technologies and smart machines, several emerging internet of things (IoT) applications have been deployed that offer significant benefits to humans. Mobile cloud computing technology can minimise the latency of IoT application execution by providing the necessary computation processing and data caching facility to resource-limited smart devices. To ensure low-latency for heavy-weight IoT application processing is particularly challenging in the mobile cloud computing environment due to the varying IoT-based application requirements, dynamically changing resources of the cloud devices or machines, network resources, mobility, varying input and output data size value of caching, and computing applications, and communication overhead. To make satisfactory application execution decisions, this paper first investigates different challenges, requirements, and latency-sensitive applications of emerging IoT. Next, we present a flexible heuristic-based prioritised resource assignment strategy for IoT application execution in the 5G era. Evaluation results confirm the suitability of the proposed scheme.",

Based on the Russian experience of managing venture investments a conceptual model of this process is compiled. It is determined that two mechanisms are involved in the process of managing venture investments in the sphere of digital education in Russia - audit and reorganisation of universities. It is proved that optimisation of the mechanisms of managing venture investments in the sphere of digital education on the basis of ICT allows solving the problem of insufficient information support of this process. The offered recommendations allow guaranteeing full-scale and highly-effective information support for audit of digital modernisation of universities and their reorganisation.",

  "abstract": "In the last few decades, several emerging technologies have come into existence, and their execution in the manufacturing sector is recognised as Industry 4.0. Always, a significant gap is observed between the developed and developing economies, especially the manufacturing aspect. Changes in the environmental and societal policies take place to meet the presumed industrial contribution. Therefore, an inclusive manufacturing system (IMS) has been proposed by immersing the sustainability factors with shifting technological advancements. This paper proposes a framework envisioning the digital twin driven manufacturing systems by incorporating a mathematical representation of inclusive manufacturing (IM) factors. A simulated case study of the manufacturing of a gate valve is presented for supporting the proposed concept.",

This analysis will allow us to draw a roadmap to direct banks towards a successful digital transformation. The data used in this work are provided from a survey sent to specialists of the financial sphere to fill a correlation's matrix between the banking processes and the digital risks.

They enhance information sharing and collaboration between SC entities. This research contributes to providing a more complete understanding of the relationships between the size of the firm and its adoption of SC digital tools and the challenges encountered. For this purpose, we mobilise the resource-based view (RBV) and analyse 311 surveys collected from SC professionals using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Our results clarify the role of firm size in SC digitalisation. More precisely, groups of different firm sizes show a significant difference of SC digital tools adoption level and our study enables researchers and practitioners to understand that this difference depends on the type of tools (either operational or support tools). In addition, this study brings a counter-intuitive result that is not consistent with previous research: there is no difference between the groups of different firm sizes with regards to SC digitalisation challenges encountered.",

  "abstract": "Building stable networks is one of the most demanding issues in the current era, as the world is increasingly reliant on computers and technology. The standard MANET protocols, software, and facilities presume a collaborative and networking atmosphere that does not consider protection. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) that track centralised network operations and detect malicious nodes are often used to supplement certain security because mitigation strategies are never sufficient. This study describes ML techniques for distributing valuable properties to IDS for green smart transportation on MANET. The performance of ML-IDSs and a review of their adequacy in MANETs help the users determine intrusion when learning about the MANET context. ML optimised KDD IDS. Ensemble learning in this IDS process gave anomaly scores to controlled packets. Our solution to actual MANET dataset shortages is this ML technique. ML techniques, simulation, and a functioning prototype had created a more resilient IDS for green smart transportation. ML-enhanced IDS detected and reduced MANET harmful activity. This research expanded IDS knowledge through ubiquitous learning.",

In healthcare, IoT facilitates medical process efficiency, enhanced patient service delivery, real-time intelligent decision making, and increased care value. As more devices communicate with each other via the internet, there is need to determine the origins of the data especially, in situations where trust is paramount such as wearable IoT. It is however difficult to determine data origins in IoT architectures since multiple IoT devices can be generating similar content; and it is important to identify individual data sources transparently. Thus, this paper proposes a combination of policy-based provenance and modelled the peer-to-peer IoT device communication as a graph network. Using Floyd's algorithm, we can verify data origins in the shortest paths between interconnected IoT devices. The results from multiple practical and real-world evaluations prove the superiority of the proposed work.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to examine the impact of digitisation on the technical efficiency of Indian banks. It has sampled public and private sector banks from 2001 and 2019 and applied panel data regression to establish the relationship between variables. The results indicate that digitisation in the Indian banking sector has an overall negative impact on the technical efficiency of banks, and there is no problem of endogeneity between the variables. Further, the study has observed that the technical efficiency of private banks has improved more than the public sector banks over the years. Therefore, it contributes to the literature by stressing the adoption of digitisation by a majority of customers for better delivery of banking services because the low adoption rate is negatively affecting the efficiency of the banks. Future researchers can explore digitisation in India's cooperative banks and microfinance institutions as they mainly serve the unbanked and rural areas.",

  "abstract": "In order to improve the effect of logistics information traceability, this paper designs an industrial product logistics information traceability method based on RFID middleware. Firstly, RFID module is constructed and connected with SSH architecture to monitor the logistics transportation process in real-time by using GPS technology. Based on this, the fractal box dimension of the location range of RFID middleware is determined to form a location update strategy. Finally, the logistics location traceability candidate area is constructed, and then the RF card location estimation method is constructed through probability statistics, taking the path with the largest probability value as the traceability path. The experimental results show that the average traceability success rate of this method is 93.54%, the location information acquisition time is less than 1.50 min, and the logistics location information matching accuracy can reach 95.1%, indicating that this method realises the design expectation.",

It identifies the important themes in the green finance literature, particularly, the strategies to increase green financing; efforts to make green investment profitable; promoting green financing using technology and policy, the role of regulators and financial institutions in the green finance agenda, and the challenges of green financing. Several cross-country observations about the challenges of green finance and solutions to green finance issues are documented. The findings show that green finance has the potential to make a significant difference in the environment, society and for climate change mitigation, but many challenges abound such as the lack of awareness about green finance, inconsistent definitions of green finance, lack of policy coordination for green financing, inconsistent policies, and lack of profitable incentives to investors and financial institutions who are willing to invest in climate change mitigation.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing is a technology that allows the conveyance of services, storage, network, computing power, etc., over the internet. The on-demand and ubiquitous nature of this technology allows for its ease of use and availability. However, due to this very reason, the cloud services, platform or infrastructure remain to be a target for attackers. The most common attack is the one that tries to take control of one or more virtual machine instances running on the cloud. Since cloud and networking technologies go side by side, it is inevitable to keep such malicious attempts at bay. Nevertheless, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are software that can detect potential intrusions within or outside a secure cloud environment. In this paper, a study of different IDS that have been previously proposed in order to mitigate or in best case eliminate the possible threats posed by such intrusions has been done.",

  "abstract": "This tertiary study systematically analyses 65 literature reviews on supply chain resilience (SCR) published in academic journals or conference proceedings. Our focus is on the vulnerabilities and capabilities of a supply chain that need to be balanced to achieve resilience. We explore the interdependencies of these two categories of SCR by developing an innovative framework to realise capabilities after identifying the SCR vulnerabilities. First, we propose a framework that systematises the vulnerabilities and capabilities identified in the literature. Then, we discuss the identified SCR characteristics based on the framework and quantitatively evaluate the literature reviews' focus on the two SCR categories. A synthesis of the research results shows the SCR characteristics addressed in the literature and reveals deficits for specific vulnerabilities. Finally, we outline future research opportunities based on these findings by mapping SCR capabilities and vulnerabilities in light of Industry 4.0 and digital supply chain developments. Then, we derive research gaps and recommended actions for practitioners in the context of SCR and Industry 4.0.",

Thus, this study aims to identify the key factors affecting the adoption of mSCM systems and explore their importance in the food distribution industry. For this purpose, a survey has been conducted among 90 companies active in the food field, and the required data was collected through a questionnaire distributed among experts and managers of these companies. Data analysis was carried out via structural equation modelling. Constructs of the research model are obtained from the combination of technology, organisation, and environment (TOE) theory and inter-organisational relationships theory (IOR), which is prioritised from the users' point of view as IOR factors, environmental factors, organisational factors, and technological factors. Besides, research findings show that in the IOR dimension, as the key factor in the adoption of mSCM, 'information sharing' is far more substantial.",

Frequent itemsets can get all candidate sets. The actual support degree of different candidate sets is calculated by scanning datasets, and the evolution model of big data storage structure of network learning behaviour is established.

The relationship between digital transformation (DT) and IR represents an underexplored field. After analysing from a theoretical point of view the emerging profiles both of IR and DT, this research investigates a sample of European companies included in the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) database. The aim is to analyse the positioning of the information about DT within the 'content elements' and to assess its different dimensions. The main findings show that the companies under analysis reported more information about DT in 'organisational overview and external environment' and in 'strategy and resource allocation'. Furthermore, technology-intensive sectors reported more about DT. Given the preliminary nature of the study and its findings, it paves the way for further research on the topic.",

  "abstract": "Vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) enable fast interconnection between vehicles and roadside infrastructure to ensure stable and continuous network services for vehicles. Data sharing, as the primary service of MANET, not only ensures vehicles can access the required information but also supports vehicles in sharing the required information with other vehicles to provide a better travel experience for drivers and passengers. However, without an effective access control scheme to protect data security, the adversaries can collect data transmitted by other vehicles during data sharing and threaten VANET's security by sending fake data. In order to address the current data-sharing scheme for vehicles that collects information from the environment with low efficiency, high maintenance cost and ineffective access control schemes, a secure and effective data-sharing scheme is proposed in this paper by improving the ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption algorithm (CP-ABE). Performance analysis and simulation experiments show that the scheme can achieve secure and efficient data sharing and enhance the driving experience. When the number of attributes is 20, the computational overhead of our scheme in the encryption phase is 3.18% of the compared scheme, while the computational overhead in the decryption phase is 44% of the compared scheme.",

  "abstract": "Security in the internet of things (IoT) is a significant challenge that needs utter attention. Traditionally, cryptology was used to secure the IoT network. But the need for fixed infrastructure, huge memory, and high computational power, had compelled it to be unsuitable for resource constraint IoT nodes. Therefore, this paper presents a trust-based network-coded cooperative framework known as coded cooperative trust (CCT). The proposed scheme evaluates the trust value of sensor nodes through direct and indirect specifications. Proximity, frequency-duration, and energy attributes were utilised to evaluate direct trust value, while network code-words were structured to estimate the indirect trust value. The simulation results present that CCT had effectively identified malicious nodes and had shown great performance in terms of throughput, energy consumption, and latency by an average of 49.8%, 55.3%, and 35% respectively, when compared to AF-TNS, RTS, and TAACS-FL models. Moreover, the T-test analysis of CCT has achieved a 99% confidence level.",

  "abstract": "The concept of supply chain visibility has enabled many critical contributions to supply chains such as coping with crises more easily, better assessing risks in disruptions, enhancing flexibility and performance, constituting more resilient supply chains and ensuring sustainability. Therefore, it is acknowledged as a dynamic capability that vitally affects the success of supply chain management in the disruptive technology era. The aim of this paper is to make a tremendous contribution to the relevant literature by developing and validating a measurement instrument in this field. It deals with the structure in a more comprehensive way and in line with its theoretical framework, unlike extant measurement tools. Accordingly, the paper was performed in six steps, and the sample size consisted of 48 firms for the pilot study and 484 firms for the main study. Therefore, a nine-item and single-factor scale has been developed and validated. The paper ends with an evaluation of the findings.",

  "abstract": "Extensible markup language (XML) is a widely used data exchange format in various fields for data transmission over the web. But due to security risk, the privacy of XML documents cannot be ensured, and hence sharing of data had become the major challenge. Web vulnerabilities cause threats to XML data confidentiality and integrity. There is a set of security mechanisms such as encryption, decryption, digital signature, and validations, which are applied to XML documents. Signing a document is the commonly used method for ensuring the authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity in which only a single signer is responsible for signing a document. But nowadays, the responsibility of signing a document is shared among multiple signers instead of a single signer which results in increasing the popularity of using multi-signature schemes. Therefore, a document may have multiple signatures and the integrity of the entire document depends upon it. This arises the need of studying various multi-signature schemes. Here, in this paper, various developments in the era of multi-signature schemes as well as its application areas are discussed.",

Supply chain performance is playing a critical role and is becoming a key component in creating additional value to the organisation, especially in the current era of globalisation. This study reflects the role of supply chain performance on global value creation, where leading e-commerce sites are considered based on supply chain performance. The partial least square-structural modelling was used to test the proposed framework. Factors like 'supply chain flexibility', 'risk management capabilities', and 'customer relationship management' emerged to be the most important and crucial ones. Further studies have been conducted involving various sectors by considering the different states of affairs of particular times.",

Firstly, we aim to identify the problem where technology can intervene, namely the cutting problem. Secondly, we propose an algorithm to solve it. Thirdly, we transform this algorithm into software that will play the role of PLM within the zellige sector. Thus, the software will help the customer to choose a decoration and he must provide the surface S to decorate in m2. After this, the software tries to filter the shapes making up the decoration chosen and finally it will present the combinations between the shapes of the same colour. The results are the number of tiles that must be produced following the combinations proposed according to the surface presented and the number of shapes that must be added to the stock.",

Industry 4.0 is the result of the convergence of different digital technologies in industrial productive systems. It refers to a digitised model of manufacturing, but there is no consensus on what exactly Industry 4.0 is, where its borders are, what organisational domains it comprises, or what technologies support this model. In practical terms, any company operating under an Industry 4.0 framework is subjected to intense technological change. Therefore, Industry 4.0 must be understood as a dynamic and evolving concept. From the academic perspective, it is necessary to clarify the term, understand the underlying factors and connect Industry 4.0 with other management research streams, such as digital transformation, open innovation or corporate venturing. At the crossroads between Industry 4.0 and these fields, new research opportunities appear.",

Because of dynamic nature of MANET, it frequently undergoes routing issues resulting in packet droppings. As MANETs are mainly used for secured communication which can be established during natural calamities, battle fields, etc., the proposed work focuses on secured route identification process for information exchange with less proportion of packet loss. Secured data communication is possible only if the selected route is more secured and avoids malicious activities. The proposed work considers only registered and trusted nodes for communication. In this paper the proposed method uses 2-ACK method using secured route for overcoming the issue of attacks during routing for requested node. In this paper routing process is done using AODV which reduces the packet droppings in the network. The performance of the proposed method is better than the existing methods.",

  "abstract": "In this study, we focus on a prominent feature in Bitcoin: its volatility. This paper aims to examine the volatility action of Bitcoin's price during the COVID-19 pandemic through various angles: COVID-19 fear sentiments, investor fear sentiments, macro-financial factors, and crypto market factors. The study utilises daily data from 11 March 2020 to 31 May 2021. We implemented an ARDL bound testing approach to find cointegration, and the Toda-Yamamoto approach to further examine any existing causal relationships between the variables. The empirical results show that COVID-19 fear increased Bitcoin volatility and a unidirectional causal relation was found between them. Investor fear sentiments revealed that US dollar volatility moved in the same direction as Bitcoin volatility, while VIX was found to be insignificant. Gold, crude oil, and the stock market did not influence the volatility of Bitcoin. Overall, only crypto market factors were cointegrated with Bitcoin volatility in the long run.",

  "abstract": "AI and machine learning are revolutionary technologies being explored by the communication industry to integrate them into communication networks, provide modern services, improve network efficiency and user experience. The intrusion detection system is important for ensuring security of the industrial control system. Hence, in this paper, a machine learning assisted intrusion detection system (MLAIDS) has been proposed to analyse data flow characteristics in industrial network communication security. The progressive use of proposed ML algorithms will improve IDS functionality, especially in industrial control systems. Analysis of data flow characteristics given in this article involves the method of ensuring an adequate degree of security for a dispersed industrial network concerning some main elements, including system features, the present state of requirements, the implementation of suitable countermeasures that may lead to reducing the security risk under a predefined, acceptable threshold. The numerical results show that proposed MLAIDS method achieves high detection accuracy of 98.2%, a performance ratio of 97.5%, a prediction ratio of 96.7%, F1-score of 95.8%, and less root mean square error of 10.5% than other existing methods.",

  "abstract": "The emerging field of cryptography, Secure Computation, can be used to solve a number of distributed computing applications without loss of privacy of sensitive/private data. The applications can be simple as coin tossing, agreement between parties, or complex as e-auctions, e-voting, private data retrieval for the purpose of carrying out research on sensitive data, private editing on cloud etc. without the help of a trusted third party. For any application, confidentiality can be achieved by the use of conventional cryptographic techniques, but they require the availability data. However, it will not be possible while working with sensitive data, and there arises the need of secure computation. Any protocol on secure computation starts with the construction of garbled circuit of the underlying functionality and, the efficiency of protocol and circuit construction are directly proportional to each other. Hence, as the complexity of application increases, the circuit size increases, resulting in poor efficiency of the protocol, which in turn restricts secure computation from finding its use in day-to-day life applications. In this paper an optimised garbled circuit construction framework named FastGarble is proposed, which has also been shown to improve the time complexity of garbled circuit construction.",

  "abstract": "The continuous operation of the power system generates a large amount of state data. By querying this data, the operation status of the power system can be judged, which is beneficial for improving the stability of the power system operation. Therefore, a multilevel index based big data query method for power system state monitoring is proposed. Firstly, density clustering algorithm is used to cluster the big data of power system status monitoring. Secondly, based on the clustering results, a distance sensitive hash algorithm is used to represent the mapping relationship of data points, and a multilevel index structure is constructed to complete the query of big data for power system status monitoring. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the response time of big data queries for power system status monitoring, improves query throughput and accuracy, and achieves a maximum query accuracy of 94.24%.",

  "abstract": "Inventory control problem is faced by companies on a daily basis to optimise the supply chain process and for predicting the optimal pricing for the item sales or for providing services. The problem is heavily dependent on a key factor, i.e., demand variations. Inventories must be aligned according to demand variations to avoid overheads or shortages. This work focuses on exploring various machine learning algorithms to solve demand variation problem in real-time. Prediction of demand variations is a complex and non-trivial problem, particularly in the presence of open order. In this work, prediction of demand variation is addressed with the use-cases which are characterised with open orders. This work also presents a novel prediction model which is a hybrid of learning domains as well as domain specific parameters. It exploits the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to extract domain specific knowledge while a reinforcement learning technique is used for predicting the variations in these domain specific parameters which depend on demand variations. The new model is explored and compared with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms using Grupo Bimbo case study. The results show that new model predicts the demand variations with significantly higher accuracy as compared to other models.",

  "abstract": "Engineering drawing is one of the main objects of audit work. At present, the use of computer automatic identification technology to digitise engineering drawings has become the main method to solve the low efficiency of traditional audit work. However, few reports on solutions for sample attacks based on engineering drawings. An interference recognition algorithm for auditing engineering drawings based on optimised convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed in this paper. The purpose is to be able to proactively identify whether the engineering drawings contain adversarial samples before carrying out the audit of engineering drawings. The specific methods are as follows: ten types of images that may be embedded in engineering drawings are considered firstly; then, the LeNet and VGG networks were improved for these ten types of images, respectively. And the network model with high recognition accuracy against sample images is trained and generated. Finally, compared with the other three networks, the experimental results show that the accuracy of IVGG is improved on average 4.44% than the other three methods.",

They have been worst hit due to COVID-19 and prolonged lockdown and are facing a myriad of challenges with regard to restarting of business. One of the frequently identified challenges to the development of the MSME sector is access to finance. The significance of this challenge is higher than ever in the pandemic and post-pandemic scenario. This paper explores the issues involved in MSME financing and the opportunities offered by ICT for overcoming those issues. Digital technologies offer the potential to radically improve financial inclusion in the MSME sector by overcoming the obstacles that affect the supply and demand for financial services. This study contends and proposes a financial ecosystem backed by emerging innovative technologies that offer a holistic approach for achieving inclusive growth and bridging the gap between demand and supply in MSMEs.",

The study has considered experts from different industries like IT and ITEs, research, banking, FinTech, and retail. The data were collected from 217 industry experts through a structured questionnaire containing a five-point Likert scale for measurement, containing 20 items as independent variables and one as the dependent variable. Data analysis was done through 'exploratory factor analysis (EFA)' and multiple regression analysis. The most important factor contributing to knowledge management was found to be 'knowledge distribution' with an effect size of standardised beta (.806), followed by 'amplifying efficiency' (0.307), real-time engagement and collaboration (0.108), and 'AI as an artificial neural network' (0.080).",

The existing problem is the lack of a comprehensive framework for understanding cryptocurrency pricing. The study is necessary to help investors make informed decisions about investing in cryptocurrencies. To examine determinants of cryptocurrency prices, the study used five cryptocurrencies and employs the GMM techniques. The study used multiple variables (coin prices; coins issued per day; difficulty and market capitalisation) to test how they can determine cryptocurrency prices. Findings showed that coins that uses higher hash rate, which has higher difficulty, higher market capitalisation and has lower number of coins that are mined on daily basis, is likely to have its pricing improved over short to medium terms. Overall, this research work provides valuable insights into the factors that determine the pricing of cryptocurrencies.",

  "abstract": "In order to solve the problem of low learning efficiency of students under the traditional teaching mode, this paper proposes a new teaching mode based on VR technology to improve the learning efficiency of university students. This teaching mode is based on VR theory. It constructs VR teaching data background, including teaching organisation information and event system, which together constitute the current classroom VR immersion teaching environment. Relying on VRPC interface and high-performance CPU, it builds VR development platform, constructs WTK, Vega, MR and other teaching tools, enriches VR teaching methods. Finally, according to the characteristics and principles of VR teaching, it designs the basis. In VR teaching platform tools and teaching background appropriate teaching mode, to achieve the improvement of university students' learning efficiency. Experimental data show that the education model can effectively improve the learning efficiency of students, and the highest learning efficiency can be increased by 50%.",

  "abstract": "This study examines several asset pricing specifications applied for a sample of 72 cryptocurrencies. We extend the existing literature on asset pricing of cryptocurrencies by including higher co-moment factors, namely co-skewness and co-kurtosis. Our overall conclusion is that co-skewness and co-kurtosis are also priced in crypto-markets, but less pronouncedly than in equity/commodity/derivatives markets. Size and momentum factors further increase explanatory power, but their regression coefficients are insignificant.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a solution that would allow members of a unmanned Arial vehicles (UAV) drone fleet to cooperate with each other in order to monitor the network regarding incidents that could compromise security or impact service continuity during their mission. The proposed work implements a scheme to allow each drone to monitor the activity of immediate neighbours without a central control authority, and share that information. This is in order to decide of an action in case of a security incident or a degradation of their service has occurred. The purpose is to allow the network to be resilient and adopt itself to insure service continuity. The method we used allow the detection of incidents without the use of complex security and routing solutions, or the need to communicate back and forth with a central control authority. Our method uses four parameters to insure service continuity in the network: link quality, forwarding rate, checksum rate and mobility coordinates. This is to allow the detection of multiple incidents using the same scheme.",

  "abstract": "Nowadays, cloud computing has gained popularity because it provides a platform for pay-as-you-go services, including hardware, software, and operating environment. However, technological resources cannot only be shared, but allocated on-demand to various users. With the emerged rate of inevitable vulnerabilities and network crime activities all over the globe, cybercriminals targets cloud environments. So, the demand for digital investigation is increased drastically. These extreme challenges pose serious issues for the cloud investigation. It has an impact on the researcher community of digital forensics as well. The cloud service providers and customers have yet to establish adequate forensics capacity and support digital forensics investigations on cybercrime activities in the cloud. In this paper, we present a digital forensics-enabled cloud investigation framework. In addition, we survey previous related works based on existing cloud forensics practices, fog forensics, edge forensics, and law and highlight the significant role of cloud computing in digital forensics. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges and limitations along with the future directions.",

  "abstract": "This study explores the financing availability of small and micro logistics enterprises (SMLEs) in digital supply chain finance (DSCF). Drawing upon the signalling view and the logic of signalling-financing availability, this study constructs a theoretical model that affects the financing availability of SMLEs in five dimensions, including supervision behaviour, transaction credit, financial credit, policy environment, and financial environment. By applying partial least squares structural equation modelling, the study asserts that supervision behaviour, transaction credit, and financial credit all have a direct and significant positive impact on the financing availability of SMLEs. Moreover, financial credit has a mediation effect on supervision behaviour and transaction credit in the mediation model. Furthermore, the results confirm that policy and financial environments positively moderate effects. The results reveal that both supervision behaviour and transaction credit can impact financial credit, to achieve the purpose of credit enhancement, thereby improving the financing availability of SMLEs.",

Data forecast is another paradigm widely used, where data captured over time are analysed in order to identify and predict problematic situations that may happen in the future. After research, we did not find surveys that address IoT combined with data prediction in healthcare area in literature. In this context, this work presents a systematic literature review on internet of things applied to e-health landscape with a focus on data forecast, presenting as results 14 papers about this theme, and a comparative analysis between them. Our main contribution for literature is a taxonomy for IoT systems with data forecast applied to healthcare.

This paper discusses the research content, features, and current status of research on brain-inspired computing and proposes a brain-inspired multibranch parallel interaction model. The feature extraction of the proposed model consists of two parallel convolutional neural networks (CNNs): the main feature extractor connected to the classifier and the auxiliary feature extractor. The latter can interact with the main feature extractor for multistage feature interaction. Additionally, four parallel branches are introduced in our CNN to learn the information on the importance of different feature map positions. Given the existing attacks on self-driving cars (in the case of shining attacks), we use the proposed model for training and detection. The experimental results show that the proposed model effectively reduces the redundant information on the feature maps, improves image classification accuracy to a certain extent, and has high learning efficiency and accuracy.",

The impact of lockdown on transmission rate has been exponentially decaying the transmission rate that is very significant in order to control the spread of the disease. The proposed model can approximately predict the newly infected cases and recovered cases of COVID-19. This paper is based on SIR-based mathematical model, designed to predict the newly infected cases and recovered cases of COVID-19. The transmission rate and recovery rate parameters studied are with the impact of a lockdown situation. The simulation result predicts that the epidemic grows on August-October 2020, and after that, it started to shrink with the assumed constrained scenario. This study measures the impact of lockdown on various organisations such as the health sector, e-commerce, IT sector, etc. in India.",

The methodological approach was a systematic literature review based on bibliometric techniques, network analysis, and content analysis. The literature analysis reveals that despite the constant use of projects as a way of obtaining strategic results for the agricultural supply chain and the use of project management techniques and tools by this community, there is no mention of the role of the project manager and very little of the use of methodologies showing a low level of maturity in terms of project management. As a practical application, this paper exposes the need to discuss traditional models of the structure of the agricultural supply chain, suggesting the inclusion of the project manager as an agent of business integration. The originality of this paper is reviewing the role of both project management and the project manager in the agricultural market.",

  "abstract": "Explicit specification of the historical record of an instance or a data item is called data provenance. It has many applications in various fields with regards to its importance on capturing data flow mechanisms. However, on the other hand, there are good number of security mechanisms in place to withstand the cyber-attacks. Almost all of these algorithms uses complex mathematical calculations in providing security for the systems. Visual cryptography is a peculiar approach which uses concept of secret sharing by dividing the message into transparencies as encryption process. Upon superimposing transparencies one obtains the original message. In this paper, we propose secret sharing as a notion of security onto data provenance. Main inference of this writing is to throw a model combining above two mentioned aspects which gives away an indigenous solution in the area of information security. This proposed model is implemented with specific use case scenarios for substantiation and related analysis. Simulated results and discussion of the same is presented in the paper.",

  "abstract": "This paper aims to analyse and evaluate digitalisation in the supply chains of retail companies in Cameroon. To conduct the research, a case study of six retail companies is used to identify the digital tools used within the supply chain, as a methodological approach. As a result, the paper identifies the level of digitalisation of retail supply chains in Cameroon, which impacts the supply chain performance. Indeed, many retail companies have been successful due to the level of digitalisation (i.e., the degree of use of digital technologies) of their supply chains. Furthermore, the paper highlights the main challenges, some cultural and others infrastructural, slowing down the digitalisation process in the Cameroonian context. This paper contributes to research carried out in the field of supply chain digitalisation. In the literature, no study has yet been carried out in the Cameroonian context, in contrast to the numerous publications dealing with developed countries.",

This has resulted on shifting phenomenon of NIS from triple helix (TH) I to III in the last 68 years. The evolvement of NIS also has positively impacted and strengthen the role of universities, industries and governments in innovation and economy development. However, previous studies have illustrated the challenges faced by helixes especially the local universities in time of NIS shifting from TH I to III. This paper is aiming to revisited triple helix concept and the impact of innovation policymaking to innovation and economy performance. This paper is also to review the roles of universities in embarking on TH practices, as well as to identify the challenges to practice the model in context of Malaysia. The result from comprehensive review will allow researchers to establish a comprehensive understanding and knowledge on Malaysia's NIS timeline in TH adoption.",

Using Google attention innovation to measure network hype or investor speculation, this paper investigates the effect of network hype in the cryptocurrency market and proposes a three-factor asset pricing model composed of the market, size, and network hype factors. This paper is the first empirical study on asset pricing in cryptocurrency markets and is a unique attempt to value the cryptocurrencies prices using a factor model. The empirical results show: 1) there is a positive and significant effect of network hype in the cryptocurrency market, and network hype plays a significant role in increasing cryptocurrency prices; 2) average excess returns of cryptocurrencies are negatively correlated with their size and have a significant positive correlation with Google attention innovation; 3) our three-factor model has strong explanatory power for excess cryptocurrency returns and can explain the momentum, reversal, and liquidity factors in the cryptocurrency market.",

Although IoT represents a promising paradigm in almost all fields, the security of users' data is still a significant issue that should be thoroughly addressed. This is mainly required where sensitive information is being used such as in healthcare or military sectors. Access control is a fundamental security mechanism that has to be provided for IoT-based applications in order to limit access to users data to only authorised individuals. However, due to the high mobility and huge number of devices, controlling access is challenging. In particular, using cloud data centres inevitably leads to high delays and network overhead. This research examines the growing literature on access control for IoT with respect to security requirements.",

J2EE cross platform architecture is adopted to store a large amount of unstructured data in the cloud platform, and classify, retrieve and access control the data. The self immune recovery algorithm of fault data nodes based on cloud computing technology is used to calculate the delayed recovery degree of nodes, so as to improve the reliability of financial management auxiliary system. After experimental analysis, the system recovers nine fault nodes, which is highly consistent with the distribution of standard samples, and the robustness of the system remains above 95%. It can be seen that the financial management auxiliary function of the system designed in this paper has good reliability.",

  "abstract": "Data mining is the process of discovering patterns and correlations within the huge volume of data to forecast the outcomes. There are serious challenges occurring in data mining techniques due to privacy violation and sensitive information disclosure while providing the dataset to third parties. It is necessary to protect user's private and sensitive data from exposure without the authorisation of data holders or providers when extracting useful information and revealing patterns from the dataset. Also, internet phishing gives more threat over the web on extensive spread of private information. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) is an essential for exchanging confidential information in terms of data analysis, validation, and publishing. To achieve data privacy, a number of algorithms have been designed in the data mining sector. This article delivers a broad survey on privacy preserving data mining algorithms, different datasets used in the research and analyses the techniques based on certain parameters. The survey is highlighted by identifying the outcome of each research along with its advantages and disadvantages. This survey will guide the future research in PPDM to choose the appropriate techniques for their research.",

  "abstract": "The commercial deep learning applications require large training datasets with many samples from different classes. The generative adversarial networks (GAN) are able to create new data samples for training these machine learning models. However, the low speed of training these GANs in image and multimedia applications is a major constraint. Therefore, in this paper a fast converging GAN called CIELAB-GAN for synthesising new data samples for image data augmentation is proposed. The CIELAB-GAN simplifies the training process of GANs by transforming the images to CIELAB colour space with fewer parameters. Then, the CIELAB-GAN translates the generated grey-scale images into colourised samples using an autoencoder. The experimental results show that the CIELAB-GAN has lower computational complexity of 20% compared to the state of the art GAN models and is able to be trained substantially faster. The proposed CIELAB-GAN can be used for generating new image samples for various deep learning applications.",

Specifically, a bibliometric analysis of our conception that does not belong to the methods of classical bibliometry is presented. The analysis is established on the coupling of scientific contributions by author keywords. The results obtained systematise the scientific literature according to a complementary perspective to those of the classical bibliometry and show how they lead to different but complementary conclusions, tracing the entire excursus of the analysis to the subjectivity of the scholar, contrary to what is generally shared in the literature on the objectivity of bibliometric methods.",

Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to the classification (MICMAC) approach was applied to develop a hierarchy-based model for the 14 enablers of environmental sustainability derived through extensive literature review. Findings suggest that there is a set of variables like top management support and supportive legislation that can be considered as strategic in nature and drivers of environmental sustainability in SCs. While another set of variables like company image and reduced costs are resultant actions, which have high dependence implying that any improvement in these variables requires action on lower-level variables. It is recommended that top management should focus on variables with high driving power and low dependence.",

  "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), especially quadcopter is widely used in search and rescue, mapping, surveillance and infrastructure inspection. The quadcopter's ability to fly outdoor and return-to-home is important as it simplifies the quadcopter operation and reduces the possibilities of the quadcopter suffering damages and loss. This work proposes a system for a quadcopter performing landing operation on a moving landing platform. This system is based on coordinates of both quadcopter and the moving landing platform using Global Positioning System (GPS) and feedback control using radio frequency communication. From the GPS inputs, the system identifies the distance and yaw angle between these two points and lands on the moving platform without pilot assistance during the landing sequences. The results show that the accuracy of landing on a moving platform based on the performance of the GPS used was within the radius of 2 metres from its target landing point. This paper contributes to the advancement of quadcopter precision landing through developing methods, which use low-cost equipment without compromising the accuracy of the process. Another contribution in this paper shows the ability and accuracy of the quadcopter to execute precision landing on a moving platform without using complex image processing techniques or a high capability computer on the quadcopter, to achieve a real-time UAV navigation.",

  "abstract": "The traditional methods of PMP lacked the capability of dealing with fast-moving, complex and varying environments. Later, agility emerged as a concept of a faster and more flexible way of working, leading towards maximising the positive outcomes and enhancing the performance of the organisation in a highly volatile environment. There are a few risks associated with agility improvement of organisations, which have been identified and prioritised in this research for strategising their mitigation. Various risks that agile organisations encounter were identified from the literature and also from the experts' survey. The identified risks were further analysed using total-ISM and fuzzy-MICMAC analysis. Lastly, strategies were developed to mitigate the risks by leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies. Risk of replicating agile models, insufficient capability building, and intellectual property risks were identified as key risks leading to other identified risks. These risks need to be mitigated to have a flawless agile organisation.",

  "abstract": "With the growing prevalence of cloud computing, more and more data especially images and videos are stored in cloud servers. To ensure the security of private data, data owners usually encrypt their private data before outsourcing the data to cloud servers. It is discovered that highly correlated data exist in storage outsourcing and much useful information can be extracted from these correlated data and used for cloud-based services. In the paper, we propose a scheme of encrypted image verification in cloud computing for mobile devices. Many existing schemes focus on verification of query results for outsourced text data or identical images. Different from that, the proposed scheme aims to verify the correctness of query results for similar images. Through the successful query of similar images, power and memory resources of mobile devices can be saved. The security of our scheme is analysed in the random oracle model, and analysis shows that the scheme is secure against adaptive chosen-keyword attack. And what's more, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is an efficient one.",

This study empirically examines the critical enablers for I4.0 adoption in Indian manufacturing industries. Initially, 25 enablers are extracted from literature and screening of significant enablers is done through expert's view. The screened enablers are prioritised using DEMATEL approach. The results indicate that internet of thing (IoT) enabler got the 1st rank as it affects most of enablers significantly, followed by artificial intelligence got 2nd rank and top management support obtained 3rd rank as a driver of I4.0 adoption. The obtained outcomes provide an understanding of significant enablers which promote the I4.0 implementation in the Indian manufacturing setting. This study also facilitates industrial managers to focus on enablers as per proposed ranking during making implementation strategies for I4.0 technology.",

All these devices are monitored and controlled using a mobile device, iPhone, or iPad regardless of location or time constraint. In an IoT-based smart home network, associated users and devices need to be recognised otherwise unauthorised access reduce the security and privacy of the smart environment. In this paper, contributions are first proposed as an elliptical curve cryptography-based authentication protocol for fog nodes and users in the IoT-based smart home environment. Secondly, the simulation for security analysis of the proposed authentication protocol using AVISPA tools has been done. Thirdly, BAN logic is used to verify that the devices in the smart home environment have achieved the security goals. Finally, a comparison with some existing works has been done and it has been seen that proposed protocol achieved better security goals in a smart home environment.",

  "abstract": "Entrepreneurship plays an underlying key catalyst for local economic growth and success. Most of the research on entrepreneurial intention has been conducted in countries with an advanced stage of economic development. However, very little focus is given to developing countries, especially among young graduates. Therefore, this research examined the link between entrepreneurship education, knowledge, passion, attitude, self-efficacy, and intention among tourism and hospitality graduates in Malaysia. A total of 300 graduates from tourism and hospitality programmes throughout the country were approached to fill in the online questionnaires. With a response rate of 75%, a total of 225 data were usable for further analysis. Structural equation modelling was performed using Smart-PLS. The findings suggest that entrepreneurial education, knowledge, and passion have significant effects on attitude, self-efficacy, and intention. Additionally, the attitude was found to intercede in the relationship between education, knowledge, passion, and intention.",

During the process of 2D to 3D technology, a new block distance calculation method is proposed. Based on the relationship between gradient and position, the block distance method is improved, and a more suitable matching block is selected in the search area to fill the target block with pixels. Moreover, due to the difficulty of large area holes caused by occlusion in virtual viewpoint images, this paper proposes an improved hole filling method. Experimental results show that compared with the existing methods, the image quality of virtual viewpoint rendering was improved greatly and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM) of the proposed hole filling method were better that those of baselines.",

  "abstract": "A modern vehicle is a complex computing system consisted of various control units for computing measured data from sensors and controlling the vehicle. Modern vehicles have communication facilities for communicating with a remote system and even other vehicles on the road. All those computing and communication capacities are for making the vehicles smarter and thus improving driving safety and efficiency. However, as the modern vehicles are considered as computing systems, malicious attacks targeting the modern vehicles are increasing and this phenomenon will continue. Security threats on vehicles already become a reality, while the security threats are needed to be articulated. In this paper, we present an initial result of threat analysis especially for a telematics control unit. The identified 25 threats are presented that endanger the TCU in a specific condition.",

However, the crisis of the oil sector busts the GCC governments to change the types of their economic sectors to be more varied. Fintech is one of the major players in new GCC economics. Therefore, Fintech is one of the promote solutions that lines with the vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia. In this fact, this paper proposes a study of the Fintech implementation in Saudi Arabia, in which it analyses the different metrics involve in the process of implementation. Precisely, it focuses on three levels of implementation: Fintech initiative, Fintech regulation and Fintech in society. Finally, the paper presents a strategy recommendation to improve the implementation of Fintech in Saudi Arabia.",

  "abstract": "Big data analytics (BDA) are based on massive amounts of structured and unstructured data and should extract meaningful, accurate, and relevant data. However, what is considered as meaningful and relevant is a perception of the analyst. In our paper we focused on perceptions and not on the technical implementation of BDA. For this we looked into one of the most advanced services - the financial services market in the UK. We chose eight independent financial advisors who have had first-hand experiences with large amounts of structured and unstructured data. Results show that there is moderate enthusiasm about the new possibilities of BDA such as better decision making and better market segmentation. This implies the necessity for easy to use tools and training on the side of the financial advisor as well as on the client's side. The paper fills a research gap by analysing the actual impact of BDA on a real company and trying to measure the value of BDA for a financial organisation in form of improved customer relationship through prescriptive analytics.",

Little was discussed in literature in this regard although overwhelming questions are continually being raised in various forums without enough answers and clarifications: which of the duties/tasks can be automated, and accordingly whether it is majority since this may force the discipline to reshape itself. An open-ended questionnaire to members of association of accountants in Jordan was administered. The study arrives at a number of observations and concluding remarks; the chance of intrusion of IT/IS into accounting practice is nearly two thirds of the set of various tasks and duties that can be assigned to accountants/auditors. This result is reached through effort of breakdown of tasks and duties of accounting/auditing. Future research thereafter is discussed.",

It explores whether Industry 4.0 tools, synergised with LSS strategies, can bring performance excellence in 21st century manufacturing systems. Further, the scope and applicability of LSS 4.0 approach in Indian textile industries have been reviewed and explored for bringing a paradigm shift in this domain. LSS 4.0 is rarely applied in Indian textile cluster and this paper will definitely enhance the concerned knowledge base. Golden circle approach will make the idea more systematic and easier to understand.",

  "abstract": "By providing software-based network function services, network function virtualisation (NFV) has gained a lot of popularity due to its flexible deployment and lower operational/maintenance costs. To realise better results from the NFV, the service function chaining (SFC) requires suitable order-based virtual network functions (VNFs) execution on the virtual machines. The SFC provisioning literary works suffer from higher latency as they rely on non-dedicated resources rather than both dedicated and non-dedicated resources. An effective resource allocation approach for multiple SFC provisioning by considering associated delays, payment, deadlines, time-sensitive, non-sensitive requests, SFC sorting order were out of their investigations. To tackle these issues, this paper yields ownership, latency, and cost-based resource allocation approach for SFC provisioning for NFV-assisted networks by taking different requests, service requirements, and resources, into account. The results validate that the proposed approach achieves up to 54% SFC delay and 47% energy cost gain than the traditional approaches.",

Also, the use of IoT in the industry has become a major requirement for digitalisation transformation and high-priority business demand to increase productivity and profitability. The industrial internet of things (IIoT) is concerned with making industrial environments more connected and thus smarter. However, this transformation comes with a huge number of threats that should be addressed. The primary goal of this research paper is to provide a technical solution as well as a holistic approach (framework) of security concerns. This will be supported by a number of non-technical factors to build a resilient cybersecurity model to effectively and efficiently mitigate cybersecurity threats.",

  "abstract": "Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a critical component of information infrastructure, which has strong impacts through cybersecurity to the whole system of interconnected independent critical infrastructures, particularly in the context of fast growth of Internet of Things, where traditional critical infrastructure systems are transforming into smart cyber-physical systems. PKI is a mechanism of trust to support identity authentication, digital certification, secure communication, and privilege authorization. This paper investigates the trust mechanism used in PKIs, and we found that the major PKI specification documents do not precisely define what trust exactly means in PKIs, and there are implicit trust assumptions in the real practice of PKIs. Some assumptions may not be always true. Those implicit trust assumptions may cause different parties particularly relying parties to have different understanding about the meaning of certificates and trust; thus possibly causing misuse of trust. This paper attempts to have an in-depth analysis to PKI trust mechanism.",

  "abstract": "This study, for the first time, combines two supportive tools: bibliometric analysis of scientific mapping and content analysis of 210 published documents on tourism destination (TD) to perform a comprehensive review of TD literature. Findings explore that prior works have concentrated only on empirical validation of multiple TD areas while ignoring theoretical perspective completely. The bibliometric analysis reveals that the number of TD publications is following an ascending pattern since 2009 that can be marked by low productivity, low average citations per document, and rising author collaborations. The content analysis explores eight distinct areas within TD research: 1) service quality in TD; 2) role of culture and heritage in TD; 3) TD loyalty; 4) branding procedure and brand equity; 5) customer behaviour; 6) technological aspects; 7) tourism during pandemic situation; 8) forms of tourism.",

  "abstract": "To eradicate malnutrition problem in rural areas of developing countries like Bangladesh, the Government of Bangladesh started school feeding programme as a pilot project. But the current operational structure of the programme does not provide varying nutritious foods and has no reliable monitoring system. To eradicate the problems, this paper proposes a complete solution residing in a mobile application for school feeding programme. This paper provides a meal generation system based on remaining budget, attendance on each day, nutrition, and students' preference. After serving the selected meal, the meal serving process is monitored by first recognising students who were present before serving the meal through face recognition and then recognising if the selected meal was served through food recognition. The evaluation result verifies that our food recognition model achieves up to 98% precision and almost 80% of users are satisfied with our android application features for the school feeding programme.",

The purpose of lean logistics is to deliver the right material to the right place in the right quantity and with the right presentation efficiently. Axiomatic design is a tool that establishes a scientific basis for design activities. The first axiom of design is the independence axiom, which aims to maintain independence of functional requirements, the second axiom is the information axiom, which aims to minimise information content. As a methodology, the fuzzy information axiom and the weighted fuzzy information axiom were used in the evaluation of transport methods in terms of criteria. In the use of fuzzy information axiom and weighted fuzzy information axiom approaches, numerical, verbal and fuzzy expressions were used in the design interval data determined by logistics experts. In this study, six transportation methods were evaluated in terms of seven criteria for a real case and the most suitable transportation method was selected.",

The need of the hour is to equip the governments with early detection, prevention, and mitigation of such contagious diseases. In this paper, a supervised learning approach of the polynomial regression model is used for the prediction of COVID-19 cases in terms of the number of confirmed cases (CC), death cases (DC), and recovered cases (RC) in India. Authors have also predicted death rates and recovery rates. The recovery rate on 25th April 2020 is 21.97% and by 1st June 2020 this rate will increase to 79%. In addition to this, authors have projected a monthly percentage increase in the number of CC from 1st May 2020 to 1st December 2020. This analysis would help and enable the concerned authorities in bringing effective preventive measures into action in the process of decision making.",

However, security and privacy threats and the lack of adapted security mechanisms could significantly reduce their development and slow-down their adoption. Several researches have been conducted in order to find solutions for securing the IoT systems and reduce, even eliminate risks for user's privacy. One of the proposed solutions is context-aware security, which enables to consider relevant contextual information while implementing security mechanisms. In this paper, we will conduct a survey of context-aware security solutions that have been proposed for smart city IoT applications. Indeed, these applications have a great impact on citizen's life. For each solution, we will provide critical analysis in terms of secure context-aware management, security and privacy mechanisms. Then, we will identify the different research directions for better context-aware security in these applications.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents a conceptual framework for analysing the role of information technology in the formation of high-impact entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial decision-making is contextualised in the setting of competent teams, and where its role in economic growth is modelled as part of a minimum set of actors necessary for the generation of innovative output - so-called collaborative innovation blocs. By departing from a collective of actors, rather than the individual entrepreneur, transactions costs are shown to become central for understanding the antecedents and conditions for high-impact entrepreneurship as core strategic decisions are often based on asymmetric information and bounded rationality. Subsequently, this also implies a central role for information technology in facilitating the processes that precede high-impact entrepreneurship through its ability to bridge or reduce information asymmetries. Based on the presented framework, the development of information technology is hypothesised to particularly favour new entrepreneurs with growth ambitions, new firm entry, and high growth firms by accelerating the creation and allocation of knowledge.",

  "abstract": "With the emergence of big data, data scheduling is becoming an important field of research in distributed computing. Software data scheduler often relies on data management policies that can be defined by the user and provide high level features. Such advanced features become necessary nowadays to execute data intensive applications, and this implies that data and task schedulers should cooperate closely to address the large data processing issue and ensure an optimal distribution of data intensive applications. In this paper, we propose XtremDew, the data and task cooperative scheduler platform. We deal with the distribution of the optical character recognition (OCR) on large scale. We show, in particular, the benefit of the focus on data scheduling to distribute our OCR application. We build the data driven distributing platform by combining two existing middleware: BitDew, as the data scheduler, and XtremWeb-HEP, as the task scheduler. Taking advantage of both middlewares, XtremDew provides new features. To evaluate the efficiency of our approach, we compare different strategies of scheduling tasks and data and we present several scenarios that illustrate the benefits of using XtremDew to execute data-intensive applications.",

  "abstract": "The number of publications on the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0, short: I4.0) has increased exponentially. Likewise, significant investments by firms are planned. However, the link between purchasing and I4.0 is largely lacking even though procurement managers have high expectations. The fourth industrial revolution - which refers to the use of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with autonomous machine-to-machine communication - could have several implications for purchasing processes. Support systems for purchasers are been developed, such as contract analysis software, and the possibility of digital negotiations has emerged and could revitalise e-marketplaces. Operative processes can act autonomously, with automated demand identification in CPSs. To support the development of I4.0 strategies in purchasing, this paper contributes by clearly defining I4.0, distinguishing it from the third industrial revolution, structuring the potential development paths of I4.0 in purchasing and by presenting the result of a project to develop a I4.0 maturity model for purchasing.",

  "abstract": "Trust modelling and management strategy used identify and mitigate threats by malicious devices rely on peer recommendations to compute trustworthiness. Aggregating opinions from independent devices is crucial in such recommendation-based systems to arrive at a consensus for decision making. Existing aggregation techniques like arithmetic mean, geometric mean (weighted/non-weighted), and maximum/minimum functions ignore the risk of biased and uncertain recommendations. To encounter such vulnerabilities, we propose a novel trust assessment model, outlier and uncertain recommendation-based trust management (OUR-Trust). It uses an outlier elimination and similarity-based scheme to evaluate the recommender's credibility before aggregation for consensus and decision making. The model employs revised Dempster-Shaffer combination rule for aggregation, which considers the uncertainty factor. Effectiveness of proposed approach is analysed for a dynamic and heterogeneous IoT network of dynamic and heterogeneous devices. OUR-Trust is validated for storage, power-efficiency, and scalability in terms of convergence time for more extensive IoT networks that employ recommender systems.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to verify the perception of business process management (BPM), namely benefits, maturity, budget in the company and qualitative factors that make it difficult to measure and to understand the relevance of return on investment (ROI). It is also intended to create a conceptual model that makes it possible to evaluate the valorisation of BPM within an organisation. The results indicate that BPM has gained higher relevance and maturity in organisations, being noticed through the high range of budget that is allocated to BPM initiatives, as well as the higher outsourcing services and internal teams. Regarding the barriers of ROI's implementation, the one which is the most common one was the top managers. This study had limitations at the sample level and for future research these limitations should be overcome with the study of the dependency between economic value added and earnings per share and BPM budget variables using ROI.",

  "abstract": "Online social media platforms today have many more users than ever before. This increased fake profiles trends which is harming both social and business entities as fraudsters use images of people for creating new fake profiles. However, most of those proposed methods are out-dated and aren't accurate enough with an average accuracy of 83%. Our proposed solution, for this problem, is a Spark ML-based project that can predict fake profiles with higher accuracy than other present methods of profile recognition. Our project consists of Spark ML libraries including Random Forest Classifier and other plotting tools. We have described our proposed model diagram and tried to depict our results in graphical representations like confusion matrix, learning curve and ROC plot for better understanding. Research findings through this project illustrate that this proposed system has accuracy of 93% in finding fake profiles over social media platforms. While there is 7% false positive rate in which our system fails to correctly identify a fake profile.",

However, owing to the multiple attributes, frequencies, methods, and data volume of water quality monitoring data, the efficient access, visualisation, and analysis of monitoring data is an important research topic in monitoring work. This paper proposes a flexible data visualisation and analysis solution, FSVA-data. In this solution, various microservices-based methods are used for integrated data discovery, processing, and analysis. To monitor data series that only change gently, we propose a data-adaptive method for data scalability and a customisable chart visualisation system. Our solution is not only used for water quality monitoring in Lianjiang River, but also has great application prospects in improving the effectiveness of monitoring data systems and accelerating scientific insights in other agricultural and ecological fields.",

Various challenges for location finding and indoor signalling issues give rise to the necessity for compact and low-cost ultra-wideband sensor technology. Lockdown has played a vital role during crisis in engaging with specific conditions like position estimation in areas under LOS and NLOS caused by diffraction and reflection of UWB signals across obstacles. UWB-based localisation system with edge/fog computing is used to analyse the indoor/outdoor usage of quarantined patients reducing the transmission, which becomes a threat for society and healthcare personals. The mathematical models to symbolise various patterns utilising UWB sensors with anchors and tags were used to determine the flow of all rapid and random movements within the specified clustered locations. The proposed system achieves high classification accuracy with SVM to classify the patterns and assist frontline medical workers in containing pandemics through human interaction.",

The indoor parking environments are challenging with complex situations depending on the size, location, and structure with specified locations allocated for entry and exit. UWB provides a high precision positioning for a specific layout through the tags and anchors with accuracy at the centimetre level. In this paper, a specified indoor parking layout is identified with graph entities by visualising the trajectory through SimulNet. The indoor positioning system utilises the NLOS/LOS signal to classify whether the parking lot slots are occupied or not. The UWB positioning mode allows for defining the spatial positioning in the indoor parking lot layout. Decluttered parking spaces with reduced waiting time through graph edge node detection with specific paths for entry are validated through the UWB system. The proposed algorithm provides a real-time dynamic tracking of empty and full parking space with high accuracy.",

  "abstract": "The coalescence of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) with the internet of things (IoT) results in the concept of the internet of vehicles (IoV). IoV structures a strong backbone for intelligent transport system (ITS), however due to highly dynamic vehicular networks, the trustworthiness of disseminated messages is significant since a fake message might cause fatal mishaps on the road. To address these issues, in this article trust assisted grouping approach has been proposed to limit the malicious communication among vehicles in both dense and sparse traffic scenarios and enhance security. The key highlights consolidated in our proposed approach incorporate trust-based GH selection based on direct and indirect trust assessment parameters. Trust assessment is performed by roadside unit (RSU) to maintain the degree of trust among vehicles of the group by evaluating direct trust assessment-based parameters like realisation, reputation, experience and indirect trust assessment-based parameters like suggestion factor. Vehicle attaining supreme trust value is elected as group head, which enhances trust among group members. The performance and accuracy of our approach is rigorously evaluated under various trust assessment parameters in both sparse and dense scenarios.",

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify the level of incorporation of elements and technologies of Industry 4.0 through the innovation capabilities in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. Design/methodology/approach: We characterised the ICT sector in Medellín, Colombia, and applied a questionnaire to a specific subset of Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) firms. Findings: One of the main results suggests that although ITSM firms are not unaware of some elements of Industry 4.0, these technologies are not fully incorporated into their activities. Therefore, these organisations must make greater efforts to develop and incorporate the technologies of Industry 4.0. Originality/value: This paper shows the need for firms in the ICT sector to strengthen their resource allocation and strategic planning capabilities.",

The developed mathematical and imitation models allow simulating the process of small perishable cargoes delivery in urban areas at rendering transportation service to small cargo customers, including the service of retail chain shops, hotel and restaurant businesses. These models allow for quickly estimating the specific expenses for perishable cargoes delivery depending on price values and technological parameters. The methodology is of interest for practical use for PL-forwarders at the assessment of possible transport costs in conditions of the constantly changing demand for transport services, as well as for customers (malls, restaurants, hotels, mini-markets) of small perishable cargoes.",

  "abstract": "Over the last few years, many healthcare centres are adopting advancements done in many sophisticated technologies in order to assure the fast recovery of patients. Almost in all hospitals, a caretaker is responsible for the monitoring of intravenous fluid levels. Usually, most of the caretakers forget to change the bottle at the correct time due to their busy schedule, as a result of which the patient may face problems of reverse flow of blood towards the bottle. To address this issue, an IoT based automatic intravenous fluid monitoring system is proposed. With the installation of proposed device, the constant need of monitoring by the staff will be reduced, especially during night hours, thus decreasing the chance to harm the patient and increase the accuracy of healthcare in hospitals. Also, this system will avoid the fatal risk of air embolisms entering the patient's blood stream which leads to immediate death.",

The results show the presence of correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and cryptocurrencies in the short-medium term, and a positive impact on Bitcoin only during the first wave of the pandemic in the medium term. However, Cardano failed to act as a risk diversifier. In the long-term, our analysis shows that Ethereum, BNB, Ripple, Dogecoin, TRON, Litecoin, Stellar, and Bitcoin Cash proved their ability as strong safe haven assets, even during different periods of the COVID-19 crisis. Our results can provide helpful information for policymakers, and cryptocurrency market main and hedge funds managers during periods of uncertainty.",

However, it is worth noting that scientific and technological innovation in manufacturing industry is accompanied by risks. One of the important ways to solve technological risks is science and technology insurance. In this paper, we first analyse the development status of science and technology insurance in China, and then establish an index evaluation system by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The index evaluation system includes three layers and selects 24 indicators, which can help the insurance companies to scientifically and quantitatively evaluate high-tech manufacturing companies. It also can avoid subjective and difficult-to-quantify problems in the past evaluation process. Finally, an empirical study is showed to explain how to quantify these indicators and how to calculate the weight coefficient values for each indicator. Our findings can provide relevant countermeasures and suggestions for insurance companies, high-tech manufacturing companies, and governments.",

  "abstract": "Researchers must often decide whether to use destination port as an input feature when building predictive models for intrusion detection systems. To evaluate this feature, we use the Bot-IoT dataset with three different sets of input features. The first and second set of input features comprise all Bot-IoT features (26 variables) and all Bot-IoT features excluding destination port (25 variables), respectively, while the third includes destination port as the only feature. Our results show that classification models trained on the first (26 variables) and second (25 variables) set of input features generally yield favourable results. We note that several destination port values are associated with disproportionate label distributions. Hence, it is possible in some cases, that the classifiers have been trained to closely correlate specific attack types with specific values of destination port. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Bot-IoT study based on the destination port feature.",

  "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) employs a cloud network, and the data stored in the cloud servers are highly vulnerable to various attacks. As per the current analysis report, around 23% of IoT devices are prone to attack. The data stored in the cloud storage are highly vulnerable to attacks leading to a pullback factor of 15% in economic growth. Considering the above security of the IoT devices, this paper proposes a framework integrating the Jaya algorithm and genetic algorithm to achieve an optimal detection of intrusion in the IoT network. The JA is a parameter less algorithm that does not require any precise control parameters. In contrast, the GA is a meta-heuristic approach that produces reasonable quality solutions for complex functions. The extensive analysis of the proposed algorithm yield better performance in vital parameters like accuracy, recall and F-score.",

  "abstract": "The airport queueing network model (AQNM) primary objective is to reduce the congestion and waste the passengers' time in the airport queues, mainly while crossing the checking baggage section, immigration, boarding, and leaving the system. In the AQNM model, every time the passenger notifies, the system moves slowly, and if the queue is multiserver, the passenger can use jockeying among the queues. If the queue is a single server queue, then jockeying is not possible. Additionally, a numerical example has worked with the Monte-Carlo simulation method for queueing theory and MatLab. To show the effect of the presented AQNM model, the results of waiting time without jockeying and waiting time with jockeying has been compared.",

  "abstract": "The prominence of big data analytics and associated capabilities has been well noted in allied literature (Wamba et al., 2016). There has been increasing reliance on SC resilience for business firms to sustain their operations in the face of disruptions. While several BDA-based capabilities are important in their own ways, BDA infrastructure is the core (Wamba et al., 2016). Yet its significance in the growth of SC resilience is not understood clearly. With different types of BDA infrastructure capabilities, their inter-relationships also require empirical attention. Perceptual responses were gathered from 176 professionals engaged in BDA through an online survey. The study used partial least squares in ADANCO 2.0.1 to analyse the collected responses and hypotheses testing. Findings showed BDA infrastructure-based capabilities are strongly associated and have the potential to contribute to SC resilience development.",

  "abstract": "As a novel concept in project management, the critical chain method has attracted most researchers and project managers' attention in recent years. In this research, the internal and external source of uncertainty is considered simultaneously during the buffer estimation process. In order to identify the external risks of the project, the failure mode and effect analysis technique has been used. Additionally, the lognormal distribution function is utilised for stimulating activities duration as internal risk resources. Considering internal and external risks in a project will bring the results closer to real-world results. Finally, a real case study is experimented with to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Numerical instances show that the suggested buffer estimation method can be better than the traditional cut and paste method in projects. Various organisations can use the results of this research and individuals and, at the same time, facilitate project management.",

The proposed method simultaneously takes into account the interests of cargo-owner and transport company considering the technological features of transportation. The integrated business-criterion for a choice of the rational supply chain of perishable agricultural cargoes must be based on the simultaneous achievement by the maximal level of delivery quality and the maximal profit. The methodology is of interest to practical use for the assessment of the possible logistic costs for a carrier. This approach also considers criteria of the quality transportation which are interesting for the customer. The received dependencies allow choosing a rational supply chain on cargoes delivery on small distances and for main transportation. The approach has potential interest for the logistic companies which are carrying out planning during delivery of mass cargo and one-time orders.",

  "abstract": "With the development of computer technology and the continuous improvement of computing power, the security control of internet of things terminals has received great attention. This paper proposes a security control scheme based on quantum keys for the internet of things terminals. In the wide area network, the control commands between Alice and Bob are transmitted by quantum key encryption. In the local area network, Bob sends the decrypted plaintext to the LED microcontroller board to execute the control instruction. This paper also designs a two-way identity authentication scheme based on a hash function, a sliding window key synchronisation scheme, and an eavesdropping experiment. Through experiments, the quantum key encoding rate of the quantum key distribution system is 7.4 kbps, the average time for Alice to send instructions is 141.6 ms, the average time for Bob to decrypt instructions is 12.4 ms, and the average time for key synchronisation in the time sliding pane is 116 ms. Even after stealing Alice's ciphertext data, Eve still cannot recover the plaintext data. The scheme realises the security control of the internet of things terminal.",

Additionally, to explore and classify the associations between information types and benefits. This will reveal which type generates most benefits. Three multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods are applied to find the types of information that generate most benefits in a SC. MCDM methods can help evaluate the information in a complex problem like this. The results of all three methodologies showed an agreement on what information is most useful and most profitable for the success of the SC, when shared. The findings will benefit businesses and SCs on the development of new information management practices. Furthermore, the current paper will create a stimulus for new research on the SC coordination issue. Finally, it discusses SC's future in the digitisation era. This paper fills the literature gap by classifying the information types that are shared in a SC by linking them to the benefits of sharing.",

The study utilised an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with analysis using structural equation modelling. Two individual characteristics-perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use-appeared to be substantial antecedents of micropayment predilection and five system characteristics; compatibility, later payment, single payment platform, mobility and convenience, were found to be positively and significantly linked to the perceived usefulness, with the latter two also showing a strong significant effect on perceived ease of use. Amongst other results, the study shows the importance of trust, later payment and the strong relationship between convenience and the consumer's perceived usefulness and suggests that micropayments could be a business model, as a means to unlocking reader revenues.",

  "abstract": "Initially employed as a tool for detecting food contamination issues, traceability within the supply chain has had a long history of research. However, the view that supply chain traceability is a strategic management tool within other industries has not been fully researched. To address this research gap, this study examines the implementation of traceability through an institution theoretical lens. The research model consists of four important implementation elements of traceability: top management support (TMS), internal non-conforming process (INP), traceability information management (TIM) and supplier traceability management (STM). The model is tested with 238 responses obtained from a variety of industries using the online survey. Results of the study suggest that TMS is critical for a firm to develop an effective traceability system across supply chain. The influential pressures from organisation ownership and regulatory oversight are found to affect how implementation of traceability actually differs amongst firms.",

Recommendation systems can identify patterns in big data and reduce irrelevant data, with the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm being commonly used. Based on the found regularities in the data, it is possible to predict the most probable future events, such as emergency shutdowns of equipment, the occurrence of emergencies, etc. This paper explores the SVD method for anomaly detection in IIoT and proposes the federated singular value decomposition (FedSVD) method, which better protects large-scale IIoT data privacy. Results show FedSVD has greater accuracy and duration of calculations. A masking-based FedSVD method is proposed for anomaly detection and data protection. Choosing the optimal algorithm for IIoT and recommendation systems can automate the processing of critical parameters and improve efficiency.",

  "abstract": "The present study focuses on five cryptocurrencies co-movements physiognomies both in time and frequency domain. The present study highlighted several interesting facts related to cryptocurrencies co-movements both in time and frequency domain that have high policy and investment implications. Overall wavelet coherence diagrams clearly indicate about the very short and long contagion effect among the cryptocurrency pairs for the whole study period. The contagion effect is different at different time scales. Finally wavelet clustering diagram indicates that by investing only in XBP and BitCoin cryptocurrencies investors are not going to get any benefit from diversification. This predictable co-movements pattern among the cryptocurrencies could be the basic investment strategies to gain maximum profit by diversifying the risk in cryptocurrency investments.",

  "abstract": "Breast cancer is common disease in the today's world and many techniques are used to extract the cancer cell from the breast image. Most of the systems use features extracted from the images and these images are selected using feature selection techniques. The feature selection techniques help to a greater level in removal of irrelevant data from huge amount of data and fine tune the identification process and accuracy of relevant data. But still the prediction accuracy and number of the features selection factors are not yielding 100% prediction result. In this work, Nearest Density Fire Ant (NDFA) is proposed for breast cancer prediction and used for feature selection techniques. This technique is used for diagnosing and producing results compared to the previous methods such as Random Forest, Ant Colony and Genetic Algorithm. The proposed techniques are inspected on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) and Breast Cancer Wisconsin WDBC data sets. The experimental result shows that proposed NDFA using Fire Ant Optimisation (FAO) technique produces better results in prediction and diagnosing of breast cancer.",

It is a process that helps a machine to think like a human being and for a human being to ease his/her difficult decision-making process. Real world problems related to decision making contain uncertainty in data which cannot be very precise as per our choice; as it is seen that the interval valued fuzzy logic deals greatly with such imprecise data and gives the best outcome. This paper presents a multi criteria decision making approach using interval valued fuzzy logic through a new operator and a new algorithm which is based on various parameters of satisfaction of a buyer who wish to buy a certain item provides a great choice of satisfaction with a certain result. Finally, with the help of a case study based on a significant survey the proposed method is described.",

  "abstract": "Nowadays, fog computing plays an indispensable role in delay-sensitive internet of things (IoT) applications. However, openness and lack of human intervention make fog computing-enabled IoT (F-IoT) network vulnerable to various cryptographic attacks. Therefore, reliable mutual authentication and a key agreement scheme are essential. Many authentication schemes have been proposed for the F-IoT network. However, they are not appropriate for resource-constrained networks due to high communication and computation overhead. In this paper, centralised mutual authentication and key management scheme called CMAKM-FIoT is designed and proposed. The security analysis of proposed scheme indicates that it is robust against various cryptographic attacks. The performance evaluation has evaluated and compared with existing related schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead. The proposed scheme achieves better security than previous related schemes, according to the performance evaluation and security analysis.",

  "abstract": "Sustainability of the supply chain is a research area of major concern in recent days. Due to rapid population growth globally, demand for food and nutrition is increasing day by day. So, sustainability in the food supply chain is essentially required to meet the ever-increasing demand. In this paper, 30 sustainable indicators have been identified from various literatures in the perishable food supply chain and sorted with the help of relevant field and academic experts. An interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach has been applied to find out the interrelationship among the indicators. The level of importance of all the indicators have been analysed by using ISM and further utilised to develop models for assessing sustainability in the supply chain. The results of this study may be used as input to AHP, TOPSIS and other MCDM approach. MICMAC analysis has been applied to classify the sustainable indicators into four factors by using their dependence and driving power.",

  "abstract": "Today, mobile cloud computing is very popular, because of its characteristics, where the cloud computing offers services via the mobile networks. This makes it more attractive to attackers. Many complex attack targets cloud networks are used, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS). Thus, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on sensors and distributed IDSs are deployed to reinforce security and to protect data and services provided to customers. In this article, we propose a multi-layer and cooperative distributed intrusion detection system for mobile cloud computing (LC-IDS: layer-based cooperative IDS). The proposed LC-IDS is able to detect distributed and cooperative attacks based on risk analysis, after identifying and comparing the most used distributed intrusion detection systems, deployed in mobile cloud networks. Compared to existing works, the simulation results prove that our approach is efficient in terms of false positive and true positive rates, with minimal detection delay of 0.7 s for six OpenStack instances.",

Several methods of multidisciplinary mix-study have been explored, such as content analysis, focus group discussion, expert judgment, and analytical hierarchy process, to clarify findings. The methods have been developed in order to elaborate on eight cement construction projects during the period 2010-2018. The results show that various locations have required different options as Indonesia's geography is that of an archipelagos state. The best-chosen routes as well as the most efficient in terms of costs are by using the Asia-Europe and Intra-Asia route for international logistics. However, this research also recommends developing an alternative domestic route because of the serious level of concern found. This research is appropriate to be applied in the cement projects, but can be used in other projects with several adjustments.",

FinTech start-ups tend to be formed by, on average, three founders who complement their expertise in both the IT and financial industry fields. An average start-up capital of around USD 500,000 to USD 1 million seems to be the norm for local FinTech start-ups. Multiple funding sources are typically considered, including family funds, in many cases required by outside investors as proof of commitment. Government policies (e.g., free rental and tax cuts in early stages) were deemed important for initial growth. The study's regional focus might not validate a generalisation to other financial centres but findings contribute further understanding of the FinTech phenomenon in one of the world's most active finance markets. Future research is required to investigate other financial centres worldwide (Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Singapore, etc.).",

  "abstract": "The deregulation of energy markets in many countries has stimulated the development of energy communities. Members of these communities generate and trade energy in the general market. In addition to pursuing financial goals, they aim to achieve positive environmental and social effects. Despite the recent surge in such communities, they often lack resources and depend on subsidies to compete with traditional energy providers. New technologies could support these communities with optimising their production and consumption, providing smart services and increasing their competitiveness. By applying the multi-criteria mapping (MCM) method to data collected in focus group discussions and interviews with experts, this study explored the potential of technologies and their prioritisation for the adoption of smart services by energy communities. The study proposes an overall ranking of design options for smart energy services based on four stakeholder perspectives and on opposing views and uncertainties. The results provide insights into the potential of each option for the design of innovative information systems (IS) for energy communities.",

A systematic transformation is crucial to ensure that organisations reap maximum benefits of the revolution. This study identifies key constraints causing hindrance in smooth transformation and analyses their influence among themselves and the entire system using a neutrosophic DEMATEL approach. A group of experts were consulted from academia and industry to formulate the final list of 13 challenges which include lack of standardisation, IPR concerns, data issues and lack of skilled workforce. The results will facilitate policy makers and managers to understand their significance and prioritisation. As addressing these barriers will expedite the transformation process, possible solutions to identified barriers are discussed to provide future direction on overcoming these challenges.",

  "abstract": "Tourism is the deed of every individual who loves to travel for leisure, entertainment, sports, or other purpose and usually stay in places outside their environment. It involves hospitality, health, sports, education, or entertainment. Tourism is often connected with the individual intentions to discover the facts and findings of the environment. But, the COVID-19 pandemic contamination has furiously affected the kind of tourism industry across the world and waiting for the biggest downfall ever in the history of tourism. It not only affected the common inter and intraregional travel but also badly hit the global tourism sectors. In this article, an impact study of COVID-19 on tourism sustainability is performed with an in-depth discussion on various issues and challenges. Further, an effective analytical perspective is presented on the applications of intelligent computing techniques to meet the challenges of tourism concerning COVID-19. This study will be helpful for effective analysis on different tourism sectors in a post-pandemic scenario along with a special focus towards the enhancement of domain knowledge of different stakeholders, industries, and government organisations.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust and user-friendly multi-factor authentication scheme without using smart card to reduce the operational overhead and hardware cost incurred due to the card reader. It also eliminates the issues when the smart card is lost/stolen. Secondly, we delegate a part of the computational load of the RAC to the server to balance the load between RAC and server. Thirdly, we introduce the location information of the user's device as another factor without using the GPS service of the mobile device. It helps to authenticate a user with a single sign-on to receive several related services without entering his user ID, password and biometric data again and again. Our scheme uses elliptic curve-based cryptography (ECC) to achieve a robust system with less memory consumption. We have analysed our authentication scheme from several online security threats and verified it to be safe using the Scyther Tool.",

  "abstract": "The economic downturn that followed the COVID-19 pandemic is widely considered the worst since the Second World War. This study builds on past research by aiming to give an up-to-date research environment over a more extended period for business economics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The application of bibliometric and content analysis is linked to the concept of crisis management. The COVID-19 pandemic has gone through several phases, including pre-crisis, events, crisis response management, investigation, organisational learning, and implementation. From this analysis, it is found that the focus of research on the publication of business economics research so far has been in the event phase, which investigates the impacts of the pandemic on individual perceptions, inequality in work, impact on the stock market and risk, unemployment and public health, and consumption changes and consumer behaviour. The crisis response management provided by the business in dealing with the pandemic, among others, is through increasing awareness about well-being and technology adoption, locking and social distancing, and optimising information and communication management. There is still little attention given after the crisis response management phase, namely the investigation, organisational learning, and implementation phases which are essential to building resilience when facing similar crises in the future.",

  "abstract": "The digital and emerging technologies diffusion needed to support the transition from a linear to a circular economy (CE) in sub-Saharan Africa necessitates strategic infrastructure investments and policy coherence, coordination, and collaboration among stakeholders from all sectors and levels of governance. The paper used an integrative literature review to identify possible challenges limiting sub-Saharan Africa's circular economy transition. Our findings highlighted issues such as African nations' lack of technological readiness, lack of access to finance, poor basic infrastructure, low preparedness of human capital, slow decision-making among public leaders, and lack of applicable legislation as the most prevalent issues. The conclusions of this paper may be significant to the theory extension and practical knowledge required to drive positive social change in sub-Saharan Africa by informing African public leaders on the knowledge required to enact policies on technology diffusion needed to support a transition to a circular economy to support their nation's sustainable development.",

  "abstract": "In order to solve the security problems such as leakage, tampering of sensitive data in cloud storage, the previous schemes usually sacrificed communication efficiency for higher security, which caused serious computing overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the idea of Chinese Commercial Cryptographic SM9 and SM3 algorithm, and regard user identity identification as interference factor and verification mechanism, so as to propose an identity-based integrity verification scheme for cloud storage. Furthermore, we also give the security analysis under the assumption of Diffie-Hellman and discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curve. Finally, simulation results show that our scheme can not only verify the integrity of sensitive data correctly, but also resist common malicious attacks. Especially in terms of efficiency, our scheme can effectively reduce the storage and computing burden, space and time cost. This will have a certain guiding significance for the privacy protection of cloud storage in 5G environment.",

  "abstract": "Honeypot is an active defence mechanism intended to mimic a computer system concealing its identity to misguide attackers. The mechanism traps an attacker and collects intrusion information as they trespass a network environment and cause a menace for their interest. The paper proposes a honeypot tool with deadlock and livelock states to strengthen the defence mechanism and engage the attacker for a longer period. The proposed work aims to present the formal analysis of a honeypot using coloured petri nets tool. The three core components of the honeypot, such as data capture, control and collection, are included in the formal modelling to study the behavioural properties of a honeypot in a deadlock and livelock state. The main objective is to emphasise the working of high interaction honeypot in deadlock or livelock states under an attack surface. The honeypot's formal model verification using a state-space tool in coloured petri net determines that an attacker wedged in a deadlock or livelock state fails to navigate further to fulfil malicious intent, thereby deceiving an attacker for a longer period.",

In practice, many problems can be formalised using MCP and graphs where our problem is considered in the context of a dynamic environment. MCP is, however, a tricky problem NP-Complete for which suitable solutions must be designed for microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are built for specific purposes and optimised to meet different constraints, such as timing, nested recursion depth limitation, or no recursion at all due to recursion stack limitation, power, and RAM limitation. On another side, graph representation and all the algorithms mentioned in the literature to solve the MCP problem, which is recursive, consumes memory and is designed specifically for computers rather than a microcontroller.",

  "abstract": "One of the highly researched areas in distributed system is mutual exclusion. To avoid any inconsistent state of system, more than one processes executing on different processors are not allowed to invoke their critical sections simultaneously for the purpose of resource sharing. As a solution to such resource allocation issues, token-based strategy for distributed mutual exclusion algorithms as a prime classification of solutions is one of the most popular and significant ways to handle mutual exclusion in this field. Through this research article, we propose a novel token-based distributed mutual exclusion algorithm. The proposed solution is scalable and has better results in terms of message complexity compared to existing solutions. In this proposed art of work, the numbers of messages exchange per critical section invocation are 3(⌈log N⌉ - 1), 3⌈(⌈log (N + 1) ⌉ - 1)/2⌉ and 6[⌈log (N + 1)⌉ + 2(2(-⌈log (N+1)⌉) - 1)] in case of light load, medium load and high load situations respectively.",

It generates paths using Dijkstra's algorithm with the edges of the visibility graph of the map. Although Dijkstra's algorithm is used, the generated paths between the source-destinations will not be explicitly 'short paths' as an edge of the visibility graph cannot be used in multiple paths. The robots are prioritised with respect to the Euclidean distance between them. The discrete paths are converted into continuous paths using Bezier curves along the corners of the edges. The algorithm sequentially generate paths one after another based on a priority based on the Euclidean distance between their source and destination.",

We describe the forms of state participation, in particular funding of national urban digitisation projects. We also compare the approaches to institutionalisation of the smart city concept in the light of national policies and the corresponding priority areas of these policies. As a result, this study sheds light on formal institutional practices and structures, key focus areas, and mechanisms of fund allocation in smart city development in Russia and Kazakhstan.

The authors identify three models that can be considered within the context of today's development challenges often referred to as 'the Fourth Industrial Revolution' with its rapidly emerging technologies and broad-based innovation. These models are shaped in accordance with their development purposes which tend to establish their own relationship between the individual, business community, government and global society. Understanding the conditions for achieving the ultimate goal of the global society and propounding a long-term strategy for sustainable development constitute the major findings of the research. The strategy involves harmonisation of the different and divergent interests of various social groups and is aimed at creating a new social environment that is in line with the technologies of the 21st century.",

  "abstract": "The size of the business intelligence market and its growth allows to estimate the short-term substitution effect, when the labour is replaced by artificial intelligence. Positive impacts of disruptive technologies include the dematerialisation of the industrial metabolism, and less ecological impact on nature, as prerequisites for the implementation of a circular economy. The negative consequences of disruptive technologies are difficult to predict, and the paper classifies them in eight groups: psychological impact; information vulnerability; increasing information dependence; the risk of creative potential reduction; the increasing cost of waste in the green economy; loss of jobs; privacy decrease; hacking and the loss of human control over cyber systems. The Internet of Things could not appear before the digital technologies (from a personal computer to 'cloud' technologies) reached industrial maturity. Also, societal, legislation and economic challenges raised by disruptive technologies for workers and firms are discussed.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing is one of the popular technologies in the development of information technology. Cloud computing not only provides users with high-performance computing, but also meets the needs of large-scale data storage. However, because the storage service provided by cloud computing is completely transparent to users, users cannot understand whether their data is safe in the cloud computing environment. The resulting distrust has brought great obstacles to the development of cloud computing. Therefore, this paper first describes the basic knowledge and system architecture of cloud storage, and analyses the development status of cloud storage. Secondly, in order to ensure the storage security of user data in the cloud computing environment, this paper studies the data encryption algorithm, and proposes a cross encryption scheme of data security storage in the cloud computing environment. Finally, the scheme is compared with the traditional hybrid encryption method. The experimental results show that the scheme has the advantages of good encryption and decryption effect, fast execution speed and high security. It is an ideal scheme for data security storage in cloud computing environment.",

  "abstract": "The Indian automobile sector is the sixth-largest producer of automobiles globally in terms of worth and volume. India has a steady trade deficit of US$ 2 billion in auto components every year. This paper critically examined reasons for India lagging in technology adoption and transfer organically in different sectors (OEM, large, medium and small enterprises) of the automotive industry (AI). A survey was conducted on 272 enterprises located in the western region of India. The result shows that the high purchasing cost of technology, lack of awareness of IT tools, availability and retainability of skilled workforce are critical issues for small and medium enterprises compared to large enterprises and OEMs. This study determines the role of government policies, state policies, and proactive measures to contribute to AI's fortune. It is observed that AI shall replicate success stories of the Indian IT industry in terms of global reach and quality arbitrage offering to the export market.",

A total of 82 papers published from 2000 to 2021 were reviewed using preferred reporting item for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA). This study uses the SCOR model to explain the implementation of RASCM in supply chain phases as well as the EOCD-FAO framework to explain the responsible issue, including health and safety, labour rights, environmental aspect, etc. The result shows that research in RASCM dominated the source phase of the supply chain, which explains the supplier-buyer relationship. Research in other phases needs to be elaborated further. The research in simulating the dynamic behaviour of supply chain members in the collaboration process also needs further elaboration.",

  "abstract": "Phishing and fraud sites has been widespread on the internet in recent times, in which that it is becoming a source of great concern and a serious cyber security problem, as internet fraudsters target sensitive data and personal information of users, especially the username and password. Numerous approaches has been proposed and used in order to prevent and reduce these phishing websites and attacks, and protect users and their privacy. In this paper, we proposed an anti-phishing system based on machine learning algorithms and classifiers, combined with white-list and black-list techniques. We used the C4.5 classifier that generate a decision tree that provides highly accurate results in deciding whether a site is a fraudulent website or a genuine website based on its URL. Our predictive model achieved a high accuracy rate of 83%. We have modelled our system in the form of a desktop application so that the user can add the URL of the website needed to be checked, and the results appear to the user. The system combination accuracy can exceed 95%, and the execution results prove that.",

The boom in smart networks leaves companies in this sector no choice but to adhere to I4.0. The contribution of I4.0 to the progress of AM in maintenance in EED will therefore be demonstrated by a case study using simulation. The case study will concern the benefits of using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), the heart of smart grids, at Hydro-Québec Distribution (HQD), the primary supply authority in Quebec. The HQD network includes 4.3 million clients, on a territory of approximately 250,000 km2 and 680,000 overhead transformers. The results are conclusive: the number of outages will drop by 7% annually and maintenance costs will fall by at least 5% per year.",

  "abstract": "India is an agrarian economy contributing approximately 17.76% share in the country's GDP according to Statistics Times. It produces a significant amount of meat and poultry and is among the top producers of milk and fruits and vegetables. And with this responsibility arises a dire need to prevent these perishable eatables from spoiling and ultimately being wasted. To compensate for this need there is must be a world-class cold chain system. Cold storage units are temperature-controlled supply chain networks that are used to preserve fresh produce for an extended period. The Indian Government has proposed many reforms for the agriculture sector under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (2020). The purpose of this paper is to point out the importance and requirement of more robust and efficient cold storage chains in India.",

However, there is still lack of attention given to Industry 4.0 technologies application, specifically in the remanufacturing industry. This study explicitly performed a content analysis of Industry 4.0 technologies in the remanufacturing context. Thirty-six relevant studies from 2017 to 2021 were selected for critical review. The identified research gaps for future study are: The existing studies only take into account single elements of SM, not the three integrated elements of SM in Industry 4.0 technologies on the development of remanufacturing. There is a need to identify the integrated product and process data-driven sharing method to improve the efficiency in remanufacturing operations throughout the supply chain management system. It is suggested that a framework for the implementation of sustainable remanufacturing that incorporates the key elements of Industry 4.0 technology to promote SM advancement toward the circular economy should be developed.",

  "abstract": "Present day supply chains are becoming complex and uncertain, and numerous technological innovations are being incorporated to enhance them, making supply chains smarter. The purpose of this paper is to build up a transformation map to move towards smart supply chain. The paper presents a framework to formulate transformation strategy and discusses implementation strategy in detail. Several factors to consider while taking the transformation decision are also discussed. Various reported case studies and actual implementation reports of individual technologies are considered to understand and report the impacts (observed and speculated) of these transformations. Smart supply chains are critical for Industry 4.0 (fourth industrial revolution) and their need has been highlighted by numerous researchers but the literature on how to evolve into one is scant. Understanding transformation towards smart supply chain and its impacts will guide and motivate practitioners in restructuring their supply chain.",

  "abstract": "Companies in every industry and of every size are increasingly confronted with the potential for change that digitisation offers. Although scientific research has started to examine the effects of digitisation on business models by conducting case study research, this relevant field faces numerous challenges. This paper aims to answer the question of how the landscape of case study research in IS and management research is structured on the intersection of digitisation and business model innovation. Therefore, we conduct a citation network analysis of case studies. We identify both the central theoretical findings on business model innovation and the fundamental works on the case study research method. Our results reveal four relevant literature clusters. In this way, we enable future research to place its contribution both theoretically in the existing research landscape and to ensure a high methodological quality of the research.",

  "abstract": "The cloud environment is used by the application providers (APs) to host their applications in order to reduce procurement and management costs of the cloud resources. Moreover, the variation in the traffic load of the client applications and the appealing auto-scaling capability of the cloud resources have prompted application providers to seek ways to reduce the cost of their rented services. This paper describes a constructive auto-scaling mechanism based on the events in cloud systems fitted with heuristic predictors. The predictor examines historical data using these approaches: (1) Double Exponential Smoothing (DES), (2) Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES), (3) Weighted Moving Average (WMA) and (4) WMA with Fibonacci numbers. The outcomes of this model simulation in CloudSim indicate that the model can decrease the application provider's cost while preserving application user satisfaction.",

A trillion of devices are connected to the internet that are controlled and monitored in real-world applications. The main goal is to provide the automation for home appliances using IoT. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-based home automation systems are very difficult to manage with the devices using a centralised approach due to the mobility. To solve this issue, wireless home automation system (WHAS) is proposed, which uses the predictive hidden Markov model (PHMM) to control the devices efficiently and conserves the energy utilisation among the devices. The status of the devices are monitored continuously and selecting the device operation either in manual mode or automatic mode using the PHMM model. The proposed approach conserves more energy than traditional methods.",

Mode choice problem (MCP) is one of the crucial activities affecting the performance of the freight transportation. A strong consideration for the decision process in mode choice/selection issues might reduce the complexities of managing transportation network in case of disruptions such as COVID-19. Therefore, it becomes essential to understand the complexities of MCP in facilitating the transportation system and prepare lessons for future disruptions. A content and bibliometric analysis is presented on previous studies specific to MCPs in context of freight transportation. The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly, bibliometric analysis is presented to highlight the research trends. Secondly, the classification of focus research areas are presented. Lastly, the identification of challenges and issues are projected for future research domains.",

This study used network analysis to collect the major affective vocabulary of individuals in the USA, China, Indonesia, Korea, and Russia for emerging IT products and services, and thereby analysed cultural differences. Affective vocabulary was collected related to virtual reality devices, fitness trackers, drones, a call taxi service, mobile pay, and virtual currency. Vocabulary collected through a survey was categorised into major affective vocabulary through network analysis. Social awareness of products/services was confirmed through analysis of the positive/negative aspects of the vocabulary. The affect of the target IT products/services was compared and interpreted with reference to Hofstede theory.

  "abstract": "This article travels across the waters separating management and philosophy with special attention to management innovation (or management reform). More specifically, the article examines attempts to place management innovation in the context of culture transformation - from scientific to technological culture - by adopting philosophical categories. After circumscribing the field of management innovation, a definition of culture is provided in terms of ethos (the embodiment of ideas in social practice) and logos (the rationale behind practice). Then the article considers management innovation in the context of culture transformation, through a complex re-articulation of the ethos-logos relationship. The endgame of the analysis pursued throughout this article is that in a technological culture, management innovation is ineffective in providing rationale to practice.",

The key to this trust lies in security enhancements in all IoT connectivity, enabling the exchange of vast amounts of data but keeping in check their power consumption which is a very high constraint when dealing with battery-operated IoT devices. Thus, any added security primitive must take in-concern with the resource-restricted environment in terms of power consumption.

To solve the problem of poor security performance of the traditional privacy protection model, the research proposes an improved privacy protection algorithm based on the SMART algorithm by optimising the hierarchical processing of the original sensing data, which encrypts and protects the private data, and embeds the privacy protection algorithm into the government network security privacy protection model. The experimental results show that proposed algorithm has a privacy exposure probability of 0.05, a fusion accuracy of 89% and a network energy consumption of 82.5%, which is all better than comparison algorithms. It can provide better security protection to the government cybersecurity privacy protection model, and also provide a new idea for the privacy protection method of the privacy protection model.",

  "abstract": "The wide range of IoT devices and wireless devices used in healthcare, hospitals and enterprises generates a large volume of digital data that must be processed, analysed and stored. Owing to the small processing capacity of these devices, the data generated cannot be processed on-board. Therefore, we suggest offloading this data to an efficient server. Time-critical applications cannot rely on the availability of cloud servers since they are in a remote location. The paper examines algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading (DROO), coordinate descent, adaptive boosting, and then implements the K-nearest neighbour time critical optimisation algorithm as a fog offloading network topology. The offloading decision is based on the cost function, which includes latency, memory consumption and model accuracy. The topology implementing K-NN can be trained quickly and offers almost 99% accuracy when it comes to data offloading. Based on the comparative analysis, it excels over other machine learning approaches.",

  "abstract": "The paper analyses the progression of technology as an enabler in the mutual fund industries of the five emerging economies, i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The paper discusses the growth in terms of their FinTech adoption, total asset size, number of funds and average size for each industry. It compares the percentage of total assets under management in terms of global market, their equity mutual funds as a percentage of total market value, market concentration, technology as an enabler to facilitate transactions, and the distribution channels. The paper finds China as the biggest contributor among BRICS to the global mutual fund industry. Their direct digital distribution channels hold more than 80% of the sales. Following China is India, with their direct channels contributing almost 50% of the sales. While traditional channels are the norm in Brazil, South Africa and Russia, predictions indicate a digital future for them.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Export Marketing",
  "abstract": "Brand equity has become an important factor in buying decisions and is increasing the value of a product because it affects customer loyalty and satisfaction. People are more likely to buy or use products from a company if that company has stronger brand equity. With the progressively complex environment in the business sector, the export-oriented apparel industry in Bangladesh is facing extreme challenges. Customer-based brand equity has a positive effect on a company's competitive strategy and helps the company stand out on the market. Understanding the brand equity creation might help in increasing export performance of the apparel industry in Bangladesh. The capacity of brand equity to value creation for consumers and customers alike has generated a burgeoning appeal. This study examined the four factor of brand equity (brand image, brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand association) on consumers' purchasing decision exploring the causality among them. This study is quantitative in nature and a self-administered structured questionnaire was developed to collect data from 203 respondents who purchased from brand shops. Data were analysed using Spearman's ρ correlation and hierarchical regression and found that three of the four developed hypotheses were supported, and one was not supported.",

  "abstract": "Today, cloud computing is a fast emergent computational model and has become popular among users in IT world. It is the distributed computing paradigm that is continually exposed to various threats and attacks of diverse origins. On the other hand, such difficult and distributed model becomes an attractive target for intruders. Identifying the intrusions poses a great challenge for the users and providers of cloud services. Intrusion detection is one of the techniques to protect the cloud operations from severe attacks. Hence, an effective approach is designed using the proposed Taylor-feedback deer hunting optimisation-based deep maxout network (Taylor-FDHO-based deep maxout network) to detect the malicious behaviours in cloud infrastructure. However, the proposed method, named Taylor-FDHO is derived by the integration of Taylor series with feedback artificial tree (FAT) and deer hunting optimisation algorithm (DHOA), respectively. Based on the binary classification step, the process of intrusion detection is accomplished using deep maxout network. However, the proposed approach achieved the maximal accuracy, higher sensitivity, and maximum specificity of 0.9567, 0.9598, and 0.9589 based on the training data.",

A systematic literature review was used as a research methodology to answer the research questions and literatures were analysed and synthesised using the content analysis approach. Among the impacts of Covid-19 was the disruption in the food supply chain, international trade interruption in agricultural products, household food consumption and the declining consumers' trust in food safety and hygiene. In order for ASEAN member states to better respond to the disruption in food supply chain there should be encouragements toward boosting self-sufficiency in food production, adopting smart and sustainable farming methods and closer regional cooperation.",

The higher transmission rate of the virus has spread it worldwide. Vaccination is an inevitable phase to curtail the spread of the pandemic. The present study aims to develop an agent-based model to explain the distribution network of the vaccine. Grey relational analysis has been carried out to rank different states of India based on the critical variables that govern the transmission of the virus. This would help the policymakers rationally distribute the vaccines across different places. Further, sensitivity analysis has been performed with ten scenarios to compare the effects of positive and negative events, word of mouth, and the number of sessions on the distribution of vaccines. Increasing the sessions conducted per day from 163.33 by 40 and 80 increased the proportion vaccinated by 38.32 and 73.89 percentages, respectively.",

The aim of this paper is to establish the need for coupling quantitative vulnerability assessment (QVA) and complex system governance (CSG) to better inform governance of vulnerability in complex systems of systems. First, a perspective of the situation facing modern system practitioners is provided. Second, QVA is introduced as an approach to understand potential weaknesses in complex systems of systems. Third, a framework for understanding impediments to complex system performance, CSG, is suggested. Fourth, the intersection of QVA and CSG is presented as a new and novel approach to more effectively respond to challenges facing complex systems of systems. Two scenarios (i.e., navigating challenges of the New Arctic and Critical Space Infrastructure) are used to demonstrate the utility of the QVA/CSG coupling. Further research is suggested.",

The purpose of this paper was to acknowledge the potentialities and limitations of artificial intelligence in the specific area of project management by doing a systematic literature review with which it was possible to analyse and correlate the selected articles and reach some patterns and tendencies. In the end, it was clear that there is an increased interest in the scientific community in this field, although with some areas to explore.",

This paper explores the critical success factors for translating the macro opportunity to a sustainable intermodal solution for the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. The study identifies a significant growth opportunity for FMCG freight on rail, characterised by stable, naturally unitised volumes of low-price elasticity. Intermodal solutions have the potential to facilitate a significant shift of freight from road to rail, thus reducing environmental impact. However, adoption of an intermodal solution requires a more flexible, focused and responsive engagement from the rail service provider. The study succeeds in translating the quantified macro-level argument for intermodal solutions to the organisational implications and next tactical steps for the FMCG industry, to position towards sustainable implementation of intermodal solutions.",

  "abstract": "Security of information is an important factor in an electoral process in a country. Recent pervasiveness of digitalisation in every aspect of human endeavour has evolved a drastic change in the voting process of democratic decision making. The shift from the existing conventional voting systems to electronic voting system will enable faster, convenient and more reliable means of franchising citizen's voting rights even in remote voting centres. But the problem of voters' authentication and protection from malicious attacks remains dominant. In this paper, we have used a multi-factor authentication technique using fingerprint biometrics and enhanced cryptographically secured smart card to provide a more secure e-voting system's authentication. The technique involves the combination of an enhanced Feistel block cipher and first moment feature extraction technique. The results obtained from experimental simulation shows the viability of the developed technique to avert common problems encountered in voters' authentication during the electioneering process in a digitally divided democratic environment.",

  "abstract": "Internet of things interconnects increasing numbers of artefacts and individuals, allowing the setup of ambient intelligence systems in multi-domains (e.g., hospitals). Designing a suitable architectural framework is required to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of the implementation of such systems. Consolidating public services about citizens' safety and authorisation decisions when a resource is accessed in an open-dynamic environment are the main challenges that can be highlighted. Therefore, the semantic heterogeneity between the local policies of the different domains is a crucial lock for implementing this process. Our approach goes beyond the semantic web languages' weaknesses by combining the XACML-based security policy model with a semantic rules language developed during the European SembySem Project. Built on top of RDF(S), the proposed model aims to abstract the security implementation, reconcile semantic differences across multi-domain, and maintain the local security policy. Moreover, this model addresses the semantic heterogeneity of sensors' data during knowledge-sharing.",

  "abstract": "Several definitions for the term 'sharing economy' exist. Depending on the extent of consideration of the typical characteristics of a sharing economy, energy cooperatives with renewable energy capacities are part of the sharing economy. Based on an extensive literature review, this paper analyses those characteristics of the energy sector that boost or impede its alignment with the tenets of a sharing economy. Major constraints are that both electricity and heat cannot themselves be shared, and constitute low-interest products. In electricity supply, the common access to electricity grid, the transition of the energy systems towards renewable systems, amongst others, make up the principal drivers. A comparative analysis of two energy cooperatives in Germany is carried out to support analyses. Conclusions drawn depict the future role of community ownership in the energy sector.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Computational Science and Engineering",
  "abstract": "Data deduplication techniques with fine-grained access control have been applied to realise data sharing while saving the amount of storage space. However, many existing schemes can only achieve server-side deduplication, which greatly wastes the network bandwidth especially when the transmitted data is particularly large. Moreover, few existing schemes consider attribute revocation, in which the forward and backward secrecy cannot be guaranteed. To address the above problems, in this paper, we present a client-side ciphertext deduplication scheme with more flexible access control. Specifically, the data owners are divided into different domains and distributed corresponding domain keys through the secure channel, achieving proof of ownership in client-side deduplication. Besides, attribute revocation is realised through the proxy re-encryption, which need not preset the maximum number of clients in system initialisation phase. Security and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve desired security requirements while realising the efficient client-side deduplication and attribute revocation.",

Such properties include the attributes of knowledge-based value production as well as a distinctive ethos and organisational design. Based on this definition, an array of ten types of knowledge markets is introduced, with a synthetic characterisation for each category. First level types are: intellectual capital dealing, open dealing, crowd dealing, cooperative dealing, non-monetary dealing, social dealing, alternative currencies plus incentive regimes, alternative banking, open knowledge labs and emerging knowledge markets. Each category is broken down into subtypes, each subtype in turn characterised and/or exemplified. The typology description is accompanied by an extensive and updated literature review. The resulting map of knowledge markets may contribute to understand the uniqueness of these novel value-generation arrangements and capitalise on their transformative power.",

This article aimed to investigate the need for introducing an electronic bill of lading in Ethiopia. To address the issue, the paper employed socio-legal research methodology to look into whether there are factors that necessitate the introduction of electronic bill of lading in Ethiopia or not, and showed that there are actual demanding factors for introducing it in the Ethiopia foreign trade regime.",

  "abstract": "Despite numerous merits of joint new product development (NPD), a buying firm's fear of losing its proprietary knowledge and its reluctance to share the intellectual capital with its supplier may undermine an NPD effort. In addition, the buyer's engineering change orders against dynamic demands can influence NPD performances. With that in mind, this paper aims to identify important influencing factors for the NPD success through the empirical analysis of Korean firms. The major findings of this study are twofold. First, supplier absorptive capacity has a positive effect on NPD performances. Second, when the buyer's knowledge protectiveness is strong, supplier absorptive capacity negatively affects NPD performances. These results indicate that the buyer's knowledge protection policy plays a key role in the successful implementation of NPD. Finally, the buyer's willingness to share information and knowledge with the supplier is critical for the success of NPD with the buyer's backward knowledge transfer.",

According to the typical steps of the Deming cycle, after having studied the current situation (AS IS scenario) of items allocation, a simulated one (TO BE scenario) was developed for studying a new allocation strategy, and for its assessment four key performance indicators were considered: the storage and picking productivity (both expressed in terms of processed units per hour), the % of FIFO batch for multi-customer orders and the time spent for batching (measured in hours). Results from the implementation show an improvement of the KPIs under investigation, as well as the observation of the specific targets set, and consequently an optimisation of picking activities.",

The Kimberley Process was established to monitor the rough diamond trade with the objective of stemming the flow of conflict diamonds. The definition of conflict diamonds, however, often excludes human rights abuses, which has led to mounting criticism. The purpose of this paper is to examine the prevalence, magnitude, and scope of ethical issues affecting sourcing conditions in the diamond industry. The research found that ethical issues were reported in the diamond industries of several African nations, with Angola topping the list. Child labour and slavery are the most prevalent human rights abuses. In 2017, one in five diamonds in terms of volume and one in ten diamonds in terms of value may have been produced under conditions that cannot be regarded as sustainable or ethical.",

Since start-up viability is ethnocentric and culture-specific, the factors that propel sufficient funding vary significantly between different countries. This research aims to examine the implications of each determinant of funding and to identify any similarities in characteristics shared by start-ups funded by similar sources. A literature review was conducted to assess the diverse categories of start-up funding and the factors influencing it. Moreover, 240 start-ups founded by Greek start-uppers were surveyed. According to the results, information and communications technology (ICT) related start-ups with intellectual properties, a complete business plan, and tax residency outside of Greece were more likely to receive funding from venture capitals. The study's findings have significant implications for policymakers who wish to develop a national entrepreneurship strategy that will actively enhance entrepreneurial actions and can lead to national economic growth.",

  "abstract": "A rapidly growing body of scholarly research discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sharing economy (SE). This study aims to employ bibliometric analysis to examine the research themes, scholarly communities, evolution paths and research hotspots of the developing domain of COVID-19's SE research. Adopting an integrated bibliometric approach, this study analyses articles published on Web of Science from 2008 to 2019 and from 2020 to 2021. The outcomes of this study reveal that four new research themes including the COVID-19's impact were updated for the post-pandemic SE research. The scholarly communities' analysis identifies research changes of documents and published journals communities of COVID-19. The results also dig into the evolution path of the topic and instigate further research hotspots toward SE activities. Thus, we contribute to point out the research directions for the opportunities and challenges of SE after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end (E2E) verifiable e-voting system for cumulative voting without requiring any tallying authorities. To our knowledge, none of the existing e-voting systems implemented for cumulative voting are end-to-end verifiable; if there is any bug or tampering at the tallying software, the tally would be inadvertently modified without any voter noticing this. Although there are existing voting systems (e.g., mix-net-based) that could be adapted to support cumulative voting with E2E verifiability, they generally require a set of tallying authorities, which can lead to substantial complexity of finding and managing such authorities in practice. We address this issue by adopting novel cryptographic techniques to achieve E2E verifiability for cumulative voting, but without involving any tallying authorities. We formally define a model to prove the security of our system, and present the efficiency analysis to show that our proposed solution is feasible for practical use.",

  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the co-movement between COVID-19 cases and eight cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Dogecoin, Ripple, USD Coin and Bitcoin Cash) are selected based on their market capitalisations. Daily data is considered from 30 January 2020 to 19 May 2021. The continuous wavelet transform (wavelet coherence) is used to determine the time-varying co-movement between COVID-19 instances and cryptocurrencies in this research. COVID-19 and cryptocurrency prices are interlinked, as found using the wavelet method. Similar results were discovered for Tether, Binance Coin, and Ripple. Although this seems to be the case, Dogecoin appears to be an alternative investment during COVID-19. The research is unique and adds to the existing body of knowledge, even though some of the results address the function of cryptocurrencies in times of crisis. The research findings indicate that investors and crypto enthusiasts should keep an eye out in the scenario of COVID-19 scenarios when making investments in cryptocurrency marketplaces.",

  "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most crucial issues with implications for the natural environment, communities, economies, and companies worldwide. In particular, companies are subject to growing pressures to communicate their climate risks, carbon mitigation initiatives, achievements, and opportunities. This paper thus explores the status of the research on climate change reporting and future research perspectives through a systematic literature review of 80 articles published in influential accounting and management journals from 2015 to 2021. Our overview demonstrates that since climate change reporting is mainly voluntary, the lack of universally recognised standards and guidelines makes it difficult to compare research. Several drivers affect climate change reporting, while companies have to identify, manage, and report their climate-related risks to establish mitigation actions. This review therefore highlights specific opportunities to integrate and expand the existing climate change reporting knowledge, offering new insights for future research.",

  "abstract": "Internet voting (i-voting), a form of e-voting, may emerge as a potential substitute for traditional ballot-based systems. This paper addresses potential cybersecurity concerns using the sociotechnical approach and emphasised on the careful design of secure network components on which the deployment of i-voting platform thrives. Prior to such design, the various threats and cyber-attacks contemplated in an i-voting network infrastructure were categorised in line with the three major network abstractions, i.e., the core, distribution, and access levels. Configurations to mitigate network-level security issues were integrated into a network model constructed (using the eNSP tool) to support an i-voting application designed with the ASP.Net core framework. The system provided a platform to conduct penetration testing to expose any inherent security leaks in the i-voting network. From the unsuccessful penetration tests, we conclude that with appropriate cybersecurity strategy implemented, cyber-resilience and trust might be assured in an i-voting infrastructure. The implication would be a substantial cut in the expenditure during elections as well as entrenchment of public trust.",

  "abstract": "Agriculture is often pressured to adopt new technologies so that production rate can be accordingly increased. The Internet of Things (IoT) has played an essential role in modernising the agricultural practices once it can support monitoring and automated decisions on planting. Given the ascending adoption of IoT in agriculture, the main goal of this study is reporting collected evidence from the literature and summarise how IoT systems have been used to support several activities in the agriculture domain. We adopted the Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) procedure. We designed a search string executed in two Web search engines: Scopus and Embrapa repositories. We selected a total of 35 primary studies that either propose or evaluate IoT-based systems in the agriculture domain. Results suggest that, although there are different platform solutions such as web-based systems, web-and-mobile-based systems and mobile systems targeting activities such as planting monitoring and irrigation, there are still several opportunities in the area, such as (i) the conception of automated decision-making processes and supporting technologies for agriculture recurrent activities, (ii) adoption of edge computing and machine learning for information processing and automation, respectively and (iii) proposition of solutions towards reducing production costs and ecological impacts.",

With the advent of the internet of things (IoT) devices, the attack surface has extended significantly. Organisations need a cyber threat modelling approach to assess their network from the attackers' perspective to safeguard their assets better. In this study, a framework was developed to compare cyber threat modelling of various IoT networks by focusing on the capabilities of the threat actors in the light of various factors, such as accessibility, stealth, technical ability, and time. The developed framework is applied to two different networks: SCADA and healthcare IoT infrastructure for demonstration. The results suggest that it is possible to cause a physical impact in IoT-based healthcare systems by using less sophisticated cyberattacks.",

  "abstract": "In conventional cloud computing technology, cloud resources are provided centrally by massive data centres. Therefore, edge computing technology has been proposed, where cloud services can be extended to the edge of the network to decrease a network congestion. The management of the resources is a major challenge before the researcher. Therefore, in this paper, a task scheduling algorithm based on hybrid bacteria foraging optimisation (HBFA) has been proposed for allocating and executing an application's tasks. The proposed algorithm aims to minimise the completion time and maximise resource utilisation in the edge network.

  "abstract": "Traditional knowledge and cultural expressions are neither outdated nor obsolete rather, they may be extremely evolutionary, adaptable, creative, and even innovative. Traditional knowledge is usually kept solely by indigenous communities, who have different degrees of exclusivity. Misappropriation deprives craftsmen of a source of livelihood and result in a loss of income for the indigenous community. This research paper provides an overview of the various legal framework and possibilities for protecting indigenous designs and traditional cultural expressions in Canada and India. It addresses the existing national legislations to protect the indigenous designs and scenarios during which indigenous communities' intellectual property rights were exploited by large corporations, as well as instances in which indigenous communities worked with large corporations to assist them in starting enterprises. Based on the findings the current intellectual property systems are relatively weak for safeguarding the traditional cultural expressions for indigenous communities in India and Canada.",

  "abstract": "Wearable devices are very popular nowadays due to their computing and communication abilities. Limited computation, battery, and storage capabilities hinder the growth of emerging latency-sensitive wearable device-based applications. At present, the existing works on wearable computing suffered from higher latency, energy, and user payment due to lack of wearable device users mobility prediction, budget-aware offloading, deadline, resources availability, cooperation, and energy cost awareness. This paper proposes a prediction and budget-aware task offloading for wearable computing by investigating the wearable device users' payment, mobility, cloud, and network resource availability, and task requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction and budget-aware offloading scheme for wearable computing is evaluated by comparing its results with the baseline greedy and independent resource selection scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme provides a significant performance gain than the compared schemes in terms of makespan delay, user payment, utility, energy cost, and service provider profit.",

In this article, we raise the detection and defence issue of LR-DDoS attacks based on information metrics at the edge of vehicle network, in which multiple edge nodes cooperate to meet their defence requirements while reducing resource consumption. We formulate the problem as sampling the received traffic at the edge nodes, and automatically determine the attack traffic by comparing the real-time calculation information metrics value with the preset information metrics thresholds. Then, a defence algorithm for edge nodes to detect conflicting mobile subscriber international ISDN number (MSISDN) is proposed to ensure that the network continues to provide services to normal vehicles. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation and comparison are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Two main elements of destination image, including cognition and affection evaluation and perceived psychological risk, are examined to highlight the link between travellers' trust and their planning behaviour of the pre-trip stage nowadays. This cross-sectional study collected data by convenience sampling among the 439 respondents across the whole of Vietnam. The results were analysed by SEM, stating that the cognition perception towards pandemic-related content has a positive relationship on consumer trust in the post-pandemic era. Interestingly, affection evaluation and perceived psychological risk have no effect on trust in this context. The new role of personality has been significantly moderated by the links of cognition, risk and trust, as well as the interaction between e-trust and planning behaviour towards destination. The findings are expected to contribute to the knowledge of planning behaviour towards revisiting a destination.",

  "abstract": "Past studies have attempted to formulate the order decision-making behaviour of humans for inventory replenishment in dynamic stock management environments. This paper investigates whether a data-driven approach like machine learning can imitate the order size decisions of humans and consequently enhance supply chain performances. Accordingly, this paper proposes a supervised machine learning-based order size determination approach. The proposed approach is initially executed using the order decision data collected from a simulated stock management environment similar to the 'beer game'. Subsequent comparative analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully enhances all supply chain performance measures compared to other well-known ordering methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is validated on a retail case study to investigate its efficacy. This paper thus focuses on extending the past works reported in the literature by modelling human order decision-making as data-driven imitation learning and contributing to machine learning applications for order management.

Specifically, we compare the impact of accelerator programs, business angels, venture capitalists, and non-refundable capital on the acquisition of follow-on financing and exit success. We also assess differences between top investors and other investors in the respective financing form. Based on a dataset of 81,883 start-ups, we show that both the financing form and the individual investors have significant long-term effects on performance. More specifically, the relative contribution of the financing form is strongly outweighed by the experience effects of top investors. Utilising various fixed effects and probit regression models, we demonstrate that these results are valid across financing forms and apply to both interim performance and exit success.",

  "abstract": "Today, cloud services, such as virtual machines, are traded directly at fixed prices between consumers and providers on platforms, e.g. Amazon EC2. The recent development of Amazon's EC2 spot market shows that dynamic cloud markets are gaining popularity. Hence, autonomous multi-round bilateral negotiations, also known as bazaar negotiations, are a promising approach for trading cloud services on future cloud markets. They play a vital role for composing service chains. Based on a formal description we describe such service chains and derive different negotiation types. We implement them in a simulation environment and evaluate our approach by executing different market scenarios. Therefore, we developed three negotiation strategies for cloud resellers. Our simulation results show that cloud resellers as well as their negotiation strategies have a significant impact on the resource allocation of cloud markets. Very high as well as very low mark-ups reduce the profit of a reseller.",

It is a communication protocol used between a client software on an IoT device, and a server software. Modelling, formal verification and validation are crucial and necessary to increase protocol reliability. In this paper, we propose a refinement-based approach that helps us to model, to validate and to verify gradually the LwM2M specification, which was carried out using Event-B and Rodin/ProB frameworks. We present a formal model of the LwM2M client, and we verify deadlock freedom and some functional safety properties like consistency of its configuration. The verification is ensured by theorem prover and model checking techniques, and the validation is supported by animation and bounded exploration of the client formal model. Moreover, the transformation into Event-B opens several possibilities to analyse existing implementations of the LwM2M client and to derive both test cases and executable code.",

  "abstract": "This article focuses on manufacturing logistics, exploring how Italian companies are approaching Logistics 4.0. The purpose is to evaluate the state of the art of technology adoption, highlighting the main influencing factors, and showing the related benefits and obstacles. An exploratory survey was carried out on 91 Italian manufacturing companies. The significance of the influence of the factors analysed regarding the level of adoption of L4.0 has been demonstrated. The study also included eight interviews with survey respondents undertaken to validate the main insights from the survey results. The overall results indicate that the adoption of Logistics 4.0 is still immature but has huge potential. Moreover, the few companies adopting at least one technology have sought benefits related mainly to warehouse activities and efficiency in process operations. The awareness that L4.0 intends a harmonious and integrated implementation of digital technologies to support logistics processes has not yet become widespread.",

  "abstract": "The transition from a linear economic model to a circular economy is rapidly becoming a necessity rather than an option for businesses. However, research on frameworks for building and operating circular supply chains is still lacking. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper identifies drivers and challenges for redesigning supply chains for the circular economy through a systematic literature review and a multiple case study analysis. The major drivers identified are brand image improvement and expansion to new markets and customer segments. The main challenges are lack of experience and knowledge, financial investment and product design. Based on the comparative analysis of six cases of companies having implemented circular supply chain management, we propose a process framework for operating circular supply chains. Our framework builds on the well-established SCOR model and includes the two additional processes use and recover as suggested by Vegter et al. (2020). From the multiple case study analysis, we derive the required sub-processes for the eight primary management processes of this extended SCOR model. The resulting framework can be used as a blueprint for companies designing circular supply chains.",

  "abstract": "Large-scale projects are characterised by high task complexity, intense dynamics and uncertainties, and the involvement of numerous organisations. These characteristics provide the basis for governance problems such as conflicts of interest and information asymmetries. This study explores the impact of a transition from traditional contacting to performance-based contracting (PBC) on these challenges and the interplay between relational and contractual governance. In addition, this study explores how advanced digital technologies may help improve PBC's effect on governance. Both aims are addressed through an in-depth analysis of two case studies from large-scale German aerospace projects. The findings indicate that PBC can help enhance governance in large-scale projects by controlling the outcome and aligning goals. They also acknowledge the potential of behavioural control through advanced digital technologies that supply real-time information during service delivery. However, the supplier must be able to fully control the outcome for the approach to deliver the intended success.",

This study aims to identify major success factors for such supply chain management projects, with special focus on the roles of supply chain visibility and project flexibility. We adopted a mixed methods approach, comprising semi-structured expert interviews and an online survey. The findings from the interviews are used as a basis for developing a structural equation model, which is estimated with a PLS-SEM approach using survey data. We conclude that, besides excellence in project management, supply chain visibility and project flexibility are important success factors for supply chain management projects. Moreover, supply chain visibility's influence on project success is moderated by the degree of flexibility in the project.",

  "abstract": "Rapid technological advancements, including automation, digitisation, and electrification are having a significant influence on the mining industry. From exploration and geological modelling through equipment, operations and maintenance, and logistics and transportation, information technology is being used at every stage of the mining value chain. These new technologies can capture the information component of each unit of drilling and blasting operations accurately. To achieve drilling and blasting results that best fit the needs of the operation, the capacity to use information produced during these operations, as well as providing feedback loops for factual assessment is critical. Several technologies that can have a positive effect on drilling and blasting operations and pave the way for a unified approach to drilling, blast design, and blasting implementation are presented in this study. Some of the key issues, solutions and the various outcomes achieved during drilling and blasting in coal mines around the world are reported. To draw light on the advantages of technology, the major developments in drilling and blasting including utilisation of GPS aided drill rigs, intelligent drilling and charging, usage of blasting optimising software and laser technology for drilling which largely improve recovery and safety in coal mines are discussed.",

  "abstract": "In internet of vehicles (IoVs), an edge server can process related computing tasks offloaded by vehicle-mounted terminals at a close distance based on cached application services. However, if the edge server caches all possible application services, the economic benefit of the server will be reduced owing to a large number of traffic service types. Additionally, vehicle-mounted terminals information may be leaked during data transmission. Therefore, we constructed an integrated framework of edge service and federated learning for IoVs. A resource management approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is also proposed for the joint optimisation of task offloading decisions, communication and computing resource allocation, as well as edge service caching placement in IoVs. The simulation results indicate that the DRL-based approach can overcome the high complexity of a network system and large space of policy selection and has good convergence performance as well as joint optimisation effect.",

These advancements in sensor and systemisation technologies are revolutionising the information generation process in the industries they are applied. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is one such wireless transmission technology that enables sensing, counting, measuring, documenting, identifying, locating, and transmitting information in real-time. These features can help managers to manage projects more effectively. However, there exists a significant gap between RFID technologies' current acceptance versus the expected acceptance in the transportation industry. This paper presents the findings from an extensive literature review, aimed to investigate the application of RFID systems to various phases of transportation projects. This research enabled identifying the advantages and barriers to RFID adoption. Lastly, action-items are recommended for transportation agencies that will help them in adopting RFID systems in the transportation industry.",

  "abstract": "With diminishing low-cost advantages, the Chinese manufacturing industry is actively engaged in digital transformation under the pressure of global competition. By analysing the gaps between existing technology-adoption theories and digital transformation practices, we developed a theoretical framework of factors influencing artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in enterprises based on the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework. Using three case studies of Chinese heavy-manufacturing enterprises, this article explores three important aspects of digital transformation empowered by AI: technological, organisational, and environmental driving factors and we propose an AI business model to clarify the mechanism of AI technological adoption in the manufacturing industry. This study is an in-depth summary and exploration of the digital transformation of China's manufacturing industry. It theoretically supplements related research in the field of AI technology adoption, and more important, provides practical experience in moving toward a digital transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Web and Grid Services",
  "abstract": "In internet of things (IoTs), the increase in the number of devices is directly proportional to the number of applications. The exponential growth of devices increases both the network complexity and risk against topology robustness. Moreover, the network is also prone to targeted and malicious attacks. In this paper, enhanced angle sum operation ROSE (EASO-ROSE), enhanced ROSE, adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) and cluster adaptive genetic algorithm (CAGA) are proposed to cater the topology robustness issue for IoT enabled smart cities. In addition, the proposed solutions keep the nodes' initial degree distribution unchanged by maintaining the scale-free nature of the topology. Enhanced ROSE and EASO-ROSE significantly improve the topology robustness by calculating the difference in nodes' degree while rearranging the surrounding angles according to the highest degree node. CAGA and AGA also significantly improve the topology robustness by using adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation that guide both algorithms to converge towards global optimum solution. Extensive simulations are preformed to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies. Schneider R is used as a performance metric in the simulations. The results depict that the proposed algorithms perform 61.3%, 48.3%, 45.5% and 34.95%, better than simulating annealing algorithm.",

As more human services associations grasp distributed computing, they are progressively going to a blend of open, private, and hybrid cloud administrations and foundation. In fact most of the healthcare service organisations plan to utilise different cloud vendors over the upcoming years. While having multiple cloud vendors can give organisations more flexibility and redundancy, managing multiple clouds can be a challenge. It can lead to cloud sprawl, unauthorised cloud use known as shadow IT, disjointed cloud solutions, inefficiencies, and waste.",

  "abstract": "This research is an assessment of classification with neural network classifier (NNC) against various classifiers centred on working effectiveness of various classifiers. We have compared resultant factors of NBC with other two algorithms, namely ripple down rule learner (RIDOR) and simple cart in order to get comparatively efficient and accurate results. NBC performs well on categorical as well as on numerical data. Along these lines, we have proposed a model of a hybrid technology of analysing accuracy proportion of NNC with NBC, rule-based classifiers and tree-based classifiers on diagnosis of heart disease dataset. Algorithms which we have used here are NBC, ripple down rule learner (RIDOR) and simple cart. This work considered substantial dataset and distinctive methodology for the connected classifier work NBC calculation, is taken as base methodology and every methodology like RIDOR and simple cart are utilized for examination, so as to anticipate heart disease status of patients.",

  "abstract": "Nature-inspired algorithms are a relatively recent field of meta-heuristics introduced to optimise the process of clustering unlabelled data. In recent years, hybridisation of these algorithms has been pursued to combine the best of multiple algorithms for more efficient clustering and overcoming their drawbacks. In this paper, we discuss a novel hybridisation concept where we combine the exploration and exploitation processes of the vanilla bat and vanilla whale algorithm to develop a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm. We test this algorithm against the existing vanilla meta-heuristic algorithms, including the vanilla bat and whale algorithm. These tests are performed on several single objective CEC functions to compare convergence speed to the minima coordinates. Additional tests are performed on several real-life and artificial clustering datasets to compare convergence speeds and clustering quality. Finally, we test the hybrid on real-world cases with unlabelled clustering data, namely a credit card fraud detection dataset, and a COVID-19 diagnosis dataset, and end with a discussion on the significance of the work, its limitations and future scope.",

Its interoperable architecture, in both external and internal facing banking components, enables the unification and seamless collaboration of previously isolated ones. The derived workflows can be used for covering aspects from the analysis of customer data for determining the creditworthiness of the applicants, till the repayment and end of the loan. Due to the restricted human intervention the probability for errors is drastically reduced, while bank resources are made available for focusing on improving business and customer needs. In order to provide a multi-perspective evaluation of the proposed technology-driven e-loan banking system, the balanced scorecard method is employed which, by monitoring the performance of predefined KPIs, verified the applicability and significant value of the proposed platform.",

  "abstract": "In a competitive environment, organisations are focusing on the energy-efficient smart system to reduce the expenses related to energy consumption and a comprehensive literature survey shows that windows are significant sources of heat and light in an enclosed space, which increases the load on air conditioner systems to maintain the comfortable conditions inside the room. There is a need to develop IoT enabled smart window for controlling heat and light in this context. In this study, suitable devices and sensors are identified based on a systematic literature survey to develop the IoT-enabled smart window. The experimental setup is also developed to evaluate the heat flow and luminosity inside the closed room. It has been observed that the maximum temperature recorded in the room in the range of 29-30°C and results shows saving in electricity by 11 watts/hour. This study concluded that low variation is observed in the indoor lumen and temperature conditions using the PDLC film. The movements of the PDLC crystals were controlled using mobile-based technology to make the film's operation feasible and accurate. A mobile application for managing the film is found highly viable and reliable to operate.",

  "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to evaluate various inventory position-based (IP-based) and non-inventory position-based (NIP-based) replenishment policies on the performance of a serial supply chain having four stages: manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler and retailer. The IP-based policies use inventory position-based information for replenishment whereas NIP-based policies do not require such information. The performance indicators are supply chain fill rate, bullwhip effect and total cost of supply chain. An experimental study is conducted using a simulation model under no information sharing and mean customer demand information sharing scenarios and the policies are ranked for each scenario using grey relational analysis. This analysis shows that the performance of the supply chain is better when NIP-based policies are used. The statistical analysis of the impact of information sharing among the supply chain members shows that the information sharing strategy has an impact on the performance of supply chain when IP-based policies are used.",

Insights on the quantum SCM adoption, the process areas of adoption, the reasons for the adoptions and non-adoptions, and a comparison of the adopter and non-adopter firms in terms of process capabilities and firm performance are also not covered in the previous literature. The present study has created a comprehensive macro-view of SCM adoption in India based on a survey of the large manufacturing firms in India. This study finds that SCM adoption in India is low. The findings also emphasise that business case preparation is an important precursor to SCM adoption. SCM adoption results in a positive return on investment (ROI), with a lag of one to five years. Adopter firms were found to have higher operational performance, and market share than non-adopter firms. The findings of this study have practical managerial implications for practitioners, SCM vendors, consultants, researchers, and industry bodies.",

  "abstract": "The distinction between direct and indirect material procurement is widely understood in practice but only faintly described in research. To manage both, specific purchasing strategies, processes, tools, and skills are needed. With the increasing attention to purchasing competencies and the influence of digitalisation within the purchasing field, this research sheds light on the management of both commodity types, focusing on the difference in skills needed. This research takes an explorative approach by using a world café study with 81 procurement professionals to assess future purchasing skills. Results show that the responsibility for innovation buying is expected to increase for direct purchasers, a wave of internationalisation and the associated need for cultural, communication and flexibility and agility skills is expected for indirect purchasers. This research contributes by structuring previously unstructured phenomena within the human-centric profession by addressing specific purchasing roles and changing skill requirements within the field's current digital transformation.",

  "abstract": "Implementation of security in the internet of things (IoT) is a considerable challenge that requires absolute observation. Conventionally, cryptography, authentication and access controls were used for security. However, these techniques are complex and demand excess memory as alternative, thereby trust-based schemes were employed. Existing trust techniques, though suitable, depends on second-hand information which makes them slow and dependent. Therefore, this paper presents novel hybrid trust scheme, as hidden game trust (HGT). The scheme uses hidden Markov model for measuring trust of IoT node and employs game strategy that assists nodes in making cooperative-decision. To stabilise the network, an incentive mechanism is introduced that lures illegitimate nodes to behave cooperatively. Besides, idea of temporal opportunity called reboot-time is operated to improve network survivability. Simulations carried in MATLAB states HGT outperforms existing EETE and hierarchal game models in terms of energy consumption by 98% and 97% respectively and end-to-end delay by 37% and 16% respectively.",

  "abstract": "People create innovations. Consequently, organisations must create environments to support them in their innovative endeavours. The ambidextrous organisation is essential to support human centred innovation and therefore it is imperative to ascertain what the key determinants are in terms of structure and architecture, context and culture and leadership. Using mixed-method research approaches comprising case study and structured Kano model techniques, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the ambidexterity initiatives of an US medical device manufacturer's new product development (NPD) department. The findings of our study illuminate the following key insights. First, we confirm that structure and architecture, context and culture and leadership are pivotal to ensuring effective ambidexterity during exploration and exploitation activities. Second, this study identifies, categorises and prioritises those salient factors that contribute to ambidexterity that organisations should adequately address to avoid undermining their pursuit of effective ambidexterity. Finally, we outline several people management considerations that are highly relevant to enhancing ambidexterity across many determinants. Ultimately, we argue that this study's findings facilitate the creation of a business ecosystem that is more conducive to operationalising effective organisational ambidexterity.",

  "abstract": "Curricula timetabling belongs to the scheduling and planning domain of artificial intelligence, the problem largely recognised by its key importance for initiating and afterward regulating the curricula events. In the literature the issue is reflected as a resources management job against puzzling constraints. The group of hard constraints requires the vital priority and must be removed, whereas the degree of solving of soft constraints upraises the quality scale and leads to optimal solution at the end. Constraint programming is one of the contemporary techniques that shape the research work presented in this article. The research investigates a constraint programming framework to examine over the various datasets. The study proposes and implements three incremental low-level heuristics operated by min-conflict algorithm approach for solving identical but unequal benchmark scheduling instances. The framework is designed in such way to provide fair chance of randomisation and incremental calculation to parameters in order to keep up the accuracy. The acquired prominent results validated the effectiveness and correctness of proposed methodology.",

  "abstract": "In recent decades, the automatic video surveillance system has gained significant importance in computer vision community. The crucial objective of surveillance is monitoring and security in public places. In the traditional local binary pattern, the feature description is somehow inaccurate, and the feature size is large enough. Therefore, to overcome these shortcomings, our research proposed a detection algorithm for a human with or without carrying baggage. The local tri-directional pattern descriptor is exhibited to extract features of different human body parts including head, trunk, and limbs. Then with the help of support vector machine (SVM), extracted features are trained and evaluated. Experimental results on INRIA and MSMT17_V1 datasets show that LtriDP outperforms several state-of-the-art feature descriptors and validate its effectiveness.",

  "abstract": "Heart ailments or cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the diseases that incorporate the blood vessels or heart, which is common among various age groups. Though numerous techniques have been used to classify heart abnormalities, such as classification and regression trees (CART), they are less accurate. Therefore, a technique for early detection of heart ailments with more accuracy is mandatory. A model has been designed and proposed to detect the heart ailments using three-layered neural networks for better accuracy. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is used to identify arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) accurately, and the UC Irvine (UCI) arrhythmia dataset of ECG reports are used to implement a classification for different types of heart abnormalities.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a reliable spectrum sensing method using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm. Fuzzy logic acts as a decision-making system. It is used to select an optimal sensing method based on the current wireless channel state, the required accuracy of sensing, and computational complexity. Three sensing algorithms named as energy detection, feature detection and cyclo-stationary detection are used. The fuzzy decision-making system analyses the present state of SNR, availability information about the primary user, application demand on delay and accuracy. It selects optimal spectrum sensing techniques based on that analysis result. A genetic algorithm is used to choose optimal parameter selection for the selected optimal algorithm to improve the reliability further. The entire scheme is implemented on the USRP RIO SDR hardware. Performance evaluation on experiments shows that the proposed system outperforms with the probability of detection 99.7%.",

  "abstract": "Wireless body area network (WBAN) is becoming increasingly popular among researchers and patients due to its real-time healthcare services. Mobile-edge computing (MEC) can play a major role to satisfy the latency requirements of WBAN's healthcare applications. The development of a suitable computation offloading and energy savings scheme is critical for MEC-enabled WBANs due to different priorities of WBAN tasks, QoS, resource availability, and contention delay. To improve the end-to-end latency, this paper proposes a fast data transfer, emergency timeslot, processing node allocation, and energy-saving-based task execution strategy (FETES) considering WBAN user's task priority, multiple tasks, resources, availability, different delays, network connectivity, and processing devices for computation offloading. The FETES scheme supports energy-saving for sensors, hubs, and network access devices. To evaluate the delay, throughput, and energy dissipation performance of the proposed FETES scheme, a comprehensive analytical model is presented. The evaluation results show the efficacy of the proposed FETES scheme.",

  "abstract": "This paper argues that AI can improve supply chain efficiency, and transform supply chain management by providing tools for managing the functions across all the stages of a supply chain. Despite the promise, organisational and managerial challenges may limit AI and SCM integration. We explore the challenges of AI use in SCM and offer some guidelines for its successful integration. We propose that organisations need to make an economic case for AI adoption, develop a plan for AI implementation, including developing core capabilities and system trust for coordinating behaviour across the stages of the supply chain. In addition, organisations need to manage the nexus of people and technology to reduce human-machine conflict, as the goal is for AI to augment human capabilities, not to replace them. We provide the implications of the paper for theory and practice.",

  "abstract": "The toll collection is becoming a major problem on the highways leading to large waiting queues. Toll gates installed on highways result in increased waiting time and fuel usage. In this paper, a study on automated toll collection system using radio frequency identification (RFID)-based system is presented, which provides fast identification of vehicles and toll collection. Using this system, the identification can be done just by slowing down the speed of the vehicle when it is passing from the toll plaza. The RFID reader scans the RFID tag or card and deducts the amount from it. The research analysed the system by proposing a mechanism and implementing an example scenario, which considered the random arrival of different vehicles. This technique is also compared with other existing mechanisms such as number plate recognition and barcode-based passes, which showed the need to utilise this technique for toll collection.",

  "abstract": "Recently, a large amount of news articles is being created online, and news articles are important resources for understanding social phenomena and trends. Accordingly, a web portal service provides a 'portal news page' that classifies news articles published from various news sources into sections and provides each news article with a certain structure. Therefore, by analysing portal news pages, it is possible to automatically extract information about news articles. In this paper, we introduce a prototype that extracts and searches key information of news articles for analysis. Specifically, we describe: 1) a crawler that collects, analyses and parses news articles; 2) an Elasticsearch server that indexes and searches news information; and 3) a front-end application that provides a search user interface. These systems are expected to provide the foundation for news analytics and forecasting services.",

Within the IoT, fog computing offers computation, storage, and network resources to end-users. The assurance of protection is important because the services of fog computing are available to a wide number of IoT customers. This paper proposes an effective authentication and secure data access between fog and IoT users to achieve authentication and access to data and also a cipher policy-based homomorphic Paillier encryption (CP-HPE), for secure data access between fog node and user. The security and performance analysis show the scheme is apt for fog computing with IoT environment.",

This article introduces the concept of financial aptitude to hypothesise under which circumstances industrial firms are likely to introduce servitised earnings models. It builds upon insights from management reporting and financialisation theories for that purpose.

  "abstract": "Hand tremor influences a huge number of individuals around the world. Tremor is characterised as unintended, cadenced muscle development. Albeit most tremors neither reason serious medical issues nor threaten life, most patients experience many troubles in performing everyday exercises. It is humiliating to numerous individuals, particularly more seasoned people. Tremor negatively affects personal satisfaction and decreases the ability to perform everyday life undertakings such as eating, drinking, writing, and changing clothing. Some patients with mild tremor do not visit doctors if tremor does not hinder their daily life activities. Their situations often worsen over time. There is currently very few to almost no external solution existing to cope with this medical condition. We have developed a glove that is able to dynamically conceive the motion of a user's hand and ascertain the difference between intentional movement and unintentional movement. Further, we have quantified, verified and attempted to provide a haptic response to the users' fingers with the help of coin motors to help counteract the unwanted vibration.",

  "abstract": "The generation of viable layout alternatives is a critical step in production planning since the chosen layout affects the efficiency of utilising the firm's key resources such as space, equipment, materials, utility and workers. As such, it can dictate the firm's productivity and the subsequent profitability. In addition, it can influence the safety and security of plants. Considering the important role of a plant layout in production planning, a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) that produces customised plastic moulding products begins to explore the better layout alternatives than the existing one that has become the sources of production bottlenecks, shipping delays, cycle counting errors and space crunches. Such alternatives include an L-shape, a straight line and a U-shape. To determine the optimal layout among three layout alternatives, we propose systematic decision-aid tools comprised of a mathematical model, computer-aided design (CAD), an activity relationship chart and a from-to-chart. We validated the usefulness and practicality of these hybrid tools for the plant layout by applying them to the real world problem encountering the plastic moulding company in the USA. Based on our proven success through the case study, other manufacturing firms can replicate the proposed tools for other layout challenges.",

  "abstract": "Internet of things is the concept of establishing relationships and interactions with other connected devices through a network to reach a specific objective. The collected data from devices could be transformed into valuable insights by applying some intelligent learning algorithms. A distributed, permission less ledger called IOTA (MIOTA) manages micro transactions between multiple devices with the help of IoT. It provides the information about the transactions made with the specific type of crypto currency in the market. In this paper, an effective crypto currency price prediction model is proposed to identify the fluctuations in currency value from the past one-year data. Wolf search optimisation algorithm selects the best performing feature subset. Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model is employed to train and validate the data captured from the feature selection process. The proposed model attained 93% accuracy, significantly higher than the existing methods, portraysits significance and efficacy.",

  "abstract": "The field of wireless sensor networks has grown significantly due to notable research contributions in the domain of wireless networks and semiconductors. It has been noted in the recent past that WBANs significantly support a range of pervasive medical and healthcare applications. A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a task-oriented, self-organising sensor network and is an interconnection of a multitude of biomarker sensors and medical diagnostic gadgets. These backbone nodes may be embedded in the human body or planted on the human body. In this paper, we proposed a secured WBAN-based system for healthcare facilities. This model will help patients and medical professionals monitor the health of patients at any time despite their physical presence. It also discusses the utilisation of a machine learning based cloud system which keeps learning from new data sets and remains updated about new symptoms.",

But is this a 'scramble for space' a possibility, at least in the short-term, or just another dystopian exaggeration doomed to oblivion? In this article, we try to present a sobering thought on this phenomenon by assessing three key elements of space mining: the state of technology, whether there is adequate regulation of this flourishing industry, be it at the national or the international level, and the interests which are at stake should the space mining sector finally take off, and how they may develop over time, especially in a conflictive manner.",

The selected journal papers are categorised on the basis of an analytical framework that contains keywords related to supply chain management and Industry 4.0. The systematic literature review indicates that supply chain issues from an industry 4.0 perspective are under-researched. Many technical issues are unexplained, and broader methodological factors as well as how the process can be managed in organisations are major gaps in the literature. Based on the literature review we argue that supply chain researchers need to understand the major developments taking place linked to Industry 4.0 and engage in research that fills the gaps.",

To ascertain the cause for this gap, a study was conducted to identify gaps in research and knowledge regarding EHMS adoption. This study sought to quantify this lack of research by identifying the current state of EHMS globally and determines how research on implementation, influence, and adoption of EHMS has evolved; two databases were searched for literatures in EHMS, and a bibliometric analysis was performed to understand the nature of research and publication trends in EHMS. We found a relatively small number of literatures that focused on EHMS and a declining state of publication. This study highlights the need to develop a strong evidence base research to support the influence, adoption and effective implementation of EHMS in healthcare institutions.",

The proposed algorithms improve the robustness of the IoT network without changing the degree distribution of nodes. The EDE algorithm maintains the diversity in a solution space through the tri-vector mutation operation and explores the hidden areas. The crossover phase makes the algorithm's convergence fast towards the global optima. The AEDE dynamically changes the probabilities of multiple operations of the EDE with the changing environment. Also, it maintains the balance between the diversity of solution space and the convergence speed through adaptive probabilities. The EDE performs 7.13%, 31.6% and 41.8% better as compared to GA, SA and HA, respectively. The AEDE outperforms the GA, SA and HA with 11%, 35.3% and 45.4% better efficiency, respectively. The proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms in terms of robustness and convergence speed.",

  "abstract": "Innovations in technology have rendered the financial world more virtual and digitised, but in the new financial era, we are still not able to grasp the cryptocurrency market dynamically. The tools used for predicting and modelling the cryptocurrency market need proper improvisation so that the distrust of the public for cryptocurrency as a pioneering financial asset can be duly managed. The cryptocurrency market is considered to be a volatile market, also substantial portions of purchase of cryptocurrency are considered as speculations. With the rising number of cryptocurrencies and increase in market capitalisation of the cryptocurrency market, many studies have been conducted to understand the cryptocurrency markets in terms of its volatility. The present study has proposed models to understand the volatility of the cryptocurrency market to understand its popularity among investors.",

If those files are demanded by the other cloud user's then data classification encryption standard have been applied. The textual data is practiced with the enhanced RC6 method with key processing method of RC4 and RSA algorithm. These keys are used for the data decryption from the further side. The TA gives the information of the mismatch in the last prefix of the combination of the user detail and the data. If it does not match then the data will be corrupted by the blocker algorithm.

For the first time, service-based disruptive technologies are included as harbingers of the Schumpeterian economic industrial waves. The strategic, tactical, and operational importance of disruptive technologies and their resultant discontinuous innovations that underpin a new industrial wave are game-changing for state, regional, national, and global economies. However, there are always barriers, both technical and social, to new technology product adoption. The COVID-19-induced industry forcing function has created a 'low-touch economy', changing business action and creating a new normal. We focus on the challenges to the realisation of I-4.0. We use the internet of things (IoT) as our exemplar. IoT is the first service-based technology to support an industrial revolution. It challenges the traditional view of how firms compete. It is creating wealth and jobs and is an agent of societal transformation.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing is a developing technology that is yet unclear to many security issues. Data in the untrusted clouds can be encrypted using an encryption algorithm. Randomising this data provides more security which can be achieved by padding concept in the cloud. In this paper, the user's data is encrypted using padding scheme, called Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) together with Hybrid Encryption algorithm that is based on RSA (i.e., HERSA), to allow multiple parties to compute a function on their inputs while preserving integrity and confidentiality. The homomorphic encryption is performed on the encrypted data without decrypting it in computationally powerful clouds, and the Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) can be used in the cloud to ensure security and privacy of the users. In this paper, we propose a scheme that integrates the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) with homomorphic encryption to allow calculations of encrypted data without decryption. The cryptographic techniques used in our cloud model are described, and the overheads are compared with homomorphic encryption and MPC.",

  "abstract": "Crowdfunding has become a viable alternative to traditional venture capital and business angel funding. However, new ventures are prone to failure despite exceeding their funding goals. Extant literature presents broad knowledge of the antecedents of crowdfunding success but lacks insights into the causes and consequences of entrepreneurial failure, especially failure after massive overfunding via crowdfunding. We use a qualitative narrative approach to investigate how massive overfunding in crowdfunding threatens entrepreneurial activities. We present our findings as a taxonomy of the causes of failure, at the environmental, firm, and individual levels, based on actual cases that failed after receiving massive overfunding. Our framework challenges established thinking on resources and financing as measures of entrepreneurial success by providing insights into the processes leading to failure despite availability of resources. This serves as a reference for backers aiming to safely invest via crowdfunding and for startups to avoid the common pitfalls of overfunding.",

  "abstract": "The sudden pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 has led to disruption in trade, travel and commerce by halting manufacturing, industries, and all other sundry activities. Global markets plummeted, leading to erosion of around US $6 trillion within just one week during February 2020. During the same week, the S&P 500 index alone experienced a loss of more than US $5 trillion in the USA, while other top 10 companies in the S&P 500 suffered a loss of more than US $1.4 trillion. This manuscript performs multivariate analysis of the financial markets during the COVID-19 period and thus correlates its impact on the worldwide economy. An empirical evaluation of the effect of containment policies on financial activity, stock market indices, purchasing manager index and commodity prices are also carried out. The obtained results reveal that the number of lockdown days, fiscal stimulus and overseas travel bans significantly influences the level of economic activity.",

  "abstract": "According to a population-based study in India, the prevalence of depression stands at 15.1%, affecting an estimated 57 million individuals in the country. This accounts for roughly 18% of the global population. However, a significant obstacle to timely detection of depression cases is the severe scarcity of psychiatrists, amounting to a staggering 77%. To address this issue, a self-assessment method has been developed, allowing individuals to assess whether they might be experiencing depression without the need for a psychiatrist's visit. This method can also be employed by psychiatrists to augment their diagnostic process and ensure prompt patient care. The self-assessment process involves a user interface that presents a series of questions. The responses are captured through speech acoustics, eye blink rate, and EEG signals. These data are then pre-processed and analysed individually using trained machine learning (ML) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The final outcome determines if an individual is experiencing depression. Additionally, the system generates a comprehensive report that includes acoustic spectrogram features, components, individual analyses, and outputs.",

The study uses the GARCH models to identify the components of world economies that bitcoin is sensitive too as against variables that impact the global financial prudence. The empirical results of the study reveal that against dollar and euro exchange rates bitcoin returns are more sensitive. Bitcoin can be used together with gold to diversify or eliminate explicit market risks. The study presents reasonable justification over the development and relationship between bitcoin and different traded assets that pose new challenges before the global investors.

Users have higher requirements for the network, and network transmission is facing new challenges. The multi-path transmission technology based on TCP is one of the commonly used high-performance networks, but the improvement is still limited by the defects of the protocols such as queue head-of-line blocking and SYN flooding attacks. In order to further improve the efficiency and reliability of network transmission, this paper studies the multi-path network load balancing technology of SCTP, designs an application download program based on its multi-homed characteristics and CMT parallel transmission characteristics, and compares it with the existing TCP transmission technology through experiments. The result indicates that using the transmission by the parallel multi-path technique combining SCTP and CMT can improve the network performance by 70% and increase transmission reliability by 12.6%.",

  "abstract": "Many smart applications are equipped with resource constrained devices which are characterised by small computational power, limited battery power and memory. Lightweight ciphers have become a popular choice for providing security for these devices. This work aimed to evaluate the performance and security of three lightweight ciphers called Anu, LiCi and Present. The performance of the ciphers is reported in terms of throughput. Data compression techniques are applied to improve the speed and throughput of the encryption. The efficacy of the ciphers in defending statistical attacks and differential attacks are assessed with the help of statistical and sensitivity tests. Our results proved that LiCi outperforms Anu and Present in many aspects.",

  "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) has gained much popularity and has become an essential topic of research, because of its vast implementations. It has emerged as a field of great potential, impact, and growth. Despite its privacy concerns and security issues, it still is growing in demand for large-scale deployment. In this paper, we propose class-specific data encryption techniques for heterogeneous IoT devices. Devices are classified based on their computational and communication capabilities. Accordingly, different schemes for data encryption/decryption are proposed at different levels of interconnection across devices of different classes. The classification makes it easy to develop, study, and analyse the behaviour of the devices, as the devices of the same class have similar properties and performance. It also helps to develop standards of security protocols, policies, and frameworks based on the device class. Simulation experiments reveal significant improvements in the solution of encryption techniques for given scenarios.",

  "abstract": "Modelling of resilience and viability became crucial and visible research avenues for decision-making support in case of supply chain disruptions. This article discusses some research-practice paradoxes stemming from typical problem settings and assumptions in supply chain resilience and viability modelling. We show that the categories of probability, adaptability, and time are major determinants of resilience and viability modelling in supply chains. As an example, we discuss how probability-based supply chain design models can be enhanced through inclusion of adaptability and connectivity characteristics of the network elements with consideration of time. We deduce some open questions the elaboration on which can provide novel and substantial contributions in future. In particular, we stress the importance of furthering our understanding of reliable suppliers, disruption probabilities, disruption time and ripple effect estimation, value-creation perspective of resilience, and viability of intertwined supply networks.",

  "abstract": "Time synchronisation is a vital concern for any cognitive radio network (CRN) to perform dynamic spectrum management. Each cognitive radio (CR) node has to be environment-aware and self-adaptive and must have the ability to switch between multiple modulation schemes and frequencies. Achieving same notion of time within these CR nodes is essential to fulfil the requirements for simultaneous quiet periods for spectrum sensing. Current application layer time synchronisation protocols require multiple timestamp exchanges to estimate skew between the clocks of CRN nodes. The proposed symbol timing recovery method already estimates the skew of hardware clock at the physical layer and uses it for skew correction of application layer clock of each node. The heart of application layer clock is the hardware clock and hence application layer clock skew will be same as of physical layer and can be corrected from symbol timing recovery process, so one timestamp is enough to synchronise two CRN nodes. This conserves the energy utilised by application layer protocol and makes a CRN energy efficient and can achieve time synchronisation in short span.",

In order to adapt to the increasingly rapid logistics speed, it is necessary to optimise the location assignment of items in the automated warehouse. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the automated warehouse operation environment, the storage location assignment optimisation model with the shortest time of items travelling the warehouse, the minimum distance between related items and the lowest orthocentre of the shelf is proposed. Then according to the characteristics of the optimisation model and the shortcomings of the traditional genetic algorithm (GA), the defects of the GA are improved and the fusion with the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) is completed, so as to form an improved genetic simulation annealing algorithm (SAGA) for the model. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the improved fusion algorithm are verified by comparing the SA, the SAGA and the improved SAGA.",

Therefore, several energy efficient methodologies have been devised to minimise the energy consumption. The manuscript discovers and resolves limitations of the existing multiple agent schemes which include energy consumption, fault handling, itinerary planning and positioning of sink. Existing protocols placed sink at centre of sensing area. This job is very difficult in hard-to-reach territories. So, a multi agent based energy and fault aware scheme for hard-to-reach territories (MAHT) has been devised. It provides a method of accumulated impact factor (AIF) for identifying the central node with high energy. Its novel agent migration scheme improves the energy efficiency. Planning the itinerary dynamically results in fault tolerance. Proposed protocol is simulated with Castalia simulator and its performance is evaluated on various metrics demonstrating that MAHT outperforms the existing schemes.",

  "abstract": "Virtual computing labs dramatically changed education methodology with transforming traditional classroom-and lab-based learning models to self paced asynchronous ones. The Apache Virtual Computing Lab (VCL) platform allows students to reserve and use virtual machines (VMs) with a predefined configuration and software setup. In essence, it offers an educational cloud that provides preconfigured lab environments in 'desktop as a service' style. At our university, four courses of a specialisation branch are available in this form. While maintaining VCL, we faced the challenges of short-and long-term capacity planning. We analysed high-level reservation and platform-level monitoring data of five semesters and built mathematical models of workload and resource utilisation based on our observations. The main contribution of this study are data-driven approaches for: 1) predicting reservation patterns of students as course deadlines approach; 2) a regression-based estimate of typical resource utilisation of VMs; 3) elaboration of an optimised schedule of deadlines to avoid rejected reservation queries or a burst out to a public cloud. Applying these methods, fine-tuning of VM configurations and scheduling of upcoming semesters became possible, even in case of methodical/technical educational changes (e.g., modified course schedules, increasing number of attendees).",

  "abstract": "Retinal images are extensively used for the disclosure of retinal vascular disorders like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and optic neuritis. The analysis of a diagnostic retinal image using a computer is necessary to ease the optometrist for automating the load screening mechanism to identify these disorders. The primary step in technology aided diagnoses is optic disc segmentation and it is considered as an interesting search problem. The proposed methodology involves pre-processing of fundus images and optic disc localisation using Jaya algorithm. A new fitness function is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of the optic disc localisation. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is examined on different datasets such as DIARETDB1, DIARETDB0, CHASEDB1, DRIONS and DRIVE. The results infer that the proposed methodology has achieved a 99% of location accuracy and shows its superiority in localising the optic disc by comparing it with existing literature.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Embedded Systems",
  "abstract": "Given the problems of a large number of nodes, the huge demand for IP addresses and the poor security of communication between nodes in IPv6 wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a homomorphic data encryption scheme based on the SSL protocol in IPv6 network. The proposed scheme is mainly to realise the secure distribution of secret file information between the server and the corresponding network nodes. Besides, in response to the security problems of the confidential file distribution system, this paper also proposes a new SSL-based security protocol. The proposed protocol can not only securely send and receive confidential files but also limit the client's operation on confidential files. Furthermore, the protocol uses an improved fully homomorphic encryption algorithm to operate on the ciphertext. The algorithm improves the efficiency and security of transmission between nodes by reducing the size and expanding the plaintext space. Experimental results and comparisons show that the proposed scheme has the advantages of better security and availability during data transmission than other schemes.",

  "abstract": "The deployment of genome-wide association study (GWAS) requires a large amount of genomic data to support statistical analysis to obtain reliable prediction results. However, the data used in the research and the statistical information released by the research results can be used to determine the individuals corresponding to the genomic data, and there is a great privacy risk, resulting in restricted access to the genomic and other biomedical data. Therefore, researchers are paying more and more attention to data privacy protection in genome-wide association research and have developed various methods to protect private data. This article summarises the latest developments in privacy protection technology in genome-wide association research. Firstly, the article introduces the background knowledge of genome-wide association research and privacy protection technology; then, it introduces the privacy protection technology in GWAS: 1) homomorphic encryption; 2) advanced research results related to secure multi-party computing, and then discuss the advantages and limitations of the two types of methods; finally, the article summarises and prospects the development of privacy protection technology in GWAS.",

This research article aims to propose an effective design technique for IDS with regard to online applications. We develop a new set of features based on time-frequency analytics that makes use of 2-D models of monetary operations for preventing money laundering systems. As a classification algorithm, random forest is used, and clustering algorithm is used to tune the hyperparameters. Our findings imply that bitcoin exchanges would behave in an excessive reporting manner more than private banks under this law. We specifically take into account the monetary operations as a digital signal and attempt to build a classifier using a collection of frequently mined rules. Our tests on a replicated transaction dataset based on actual banking operations demonstrate the effectiveness of our suggested approach.",

I-IoT systems including data protection and threat security metrics are discussed in this paper. I-IoT layered method that is general and extended, with privacy, security features and layers detection is proposed. To protect the user's private data, security procedures and crucial management events are established amongst all the lower, moderate and higher levels. To permit data flow across the levels of the proposed cloud computed powered I-IoT paradigm, we built security certificates. The proposed systematic method eliminates potential security vulnerabilities and is also utilised in conjunction with the optimal security approaches to mitigate the security threats on cloud computed decentralised industrial IoT systems and devices. The assaults toward I-IoT systems are described in this paper, and a detailed examination of remedies to these attacks.",

An 8-bit microcontroller and a piezo transducer were used to encode data into an acoustic wave that was transferred through water and detected by another microcontroller that used an identical piezo transducer as a microphone. It is capable of delivering throughput up to 200 bps within 1-3 KHz band. It is a versatile platform that may be used in a range of circumstances and includes real-time channel characteristics to improve communication. During operation, the system can be modified as needed by changing its implementation on the microcontroller. A 12-bit DAC is used for signal generation through transmitter. With its ADC and FFT-based architecture, the receiver has a variety of unique features and enhancements.",

  "abstract": "Interoperability is an important property for different systems to be integrated. It provides interfaces from multiple data sources to support data and information integrity between various information systems. This study was aimed to: 1) designed an interoperable component to integrate several sub-systems into a centralised data centre; 2) developed a prototype based on the design to be used within an existing data centre system. Both purposes were done to support data integration as required by implementing ETL process, crypto-post, and REST service. This work has provided the solution of data integration model between information systems running on HTTP protocol. The integration model used both synchronous and asynchronous schemes. The methodology that was used in this research was research and development with agile SCRUM framework. The SCRUM framework was used to manage all processes of the development workflow before the production release. The result of the SCRUM framework implementation was burn down process chart and the retrospective logs. It shown the effectiveness of teamwork during the development and the release phases. There were three stages of testing that had been conducted consisted of white box and black box testing, followed by the performance verification.",

Setting a fair price for a frequency band reservation becomes an important task for national market regulators. This paper demonstrates that macroeconomic data are key determinants of prices paid for frequency band reservations in auctions organised in Europe. In an empirical analysis, we identified a positive link between log(price of 1 MHz) and log(GDP) and a negative link between log(price of 1 MHz) and log(unemployment rate). To ensure that our results are robust to the choice of the model type, we implemented two estimation methods and used two samples.",

Firstly, the paper analyses the transportation mode of enterprise intelligent logistics under Industry 4.0, and defines each link of intelligent logistics. Secondly, according to the transportation characteristics of smart logistics, the logistics cost factor is obtained and the weight of logistics cost factor is calculated. According to the weight calculation results of logistics cost factors, the total logistics cost is calculated. Finally, using a Likert scale, the level of logistics cost is judged, and the enterprise logistics cost management is completed. The experimental results show that this method can accurately calculate the weight of logistics cost factors and the total logistics cost, and it is more reasonable for enterprise logistics cost management.",

  "abstract": "The farmers are facing a lot of challenges and one of the main problems they face is because of plant diseases. The energy to the disease fungi is taken from the plants which they live on. They are responsible for the huge damage and the damages are classified into wilting, rusts, blotches, scabs, mouldy coatings, and rotted tissue. Most of the farmers are being affected with huge losses as they do not find the right solution for a certain disease that their crops have. The primary goal of this research is to find the common diseases in the plants and suggest the optimal solution that helps in reducing the fault rate of crops and in turn, it increases the crop yield. This would lower the crop damage drastically and the consumers can purchase better quality products. We propose to use deep learning techniques to identify diseases in crops in real-time, the same can be made as a mobile app that could help farmers or anyone to detect the diseases for the plants. The system is found to be functionally very stable and works under all ideal conditions.",

If we review the past data on attendance tracking systems in industries, organisations and many companies use unique identification methodologies, such as RFID, fingerprint identification, eye recognition and facial recognition systems. Among all these strategies, face recognition is the most common and least time-consuming method. The system gives more flexibility and ease to employees and organisations in marking and managing their attendance. It employs the Haar Cascade Classifier for detecting the face and the local binary patterns histograms (LBPH) algorithm to train the classifier. After the successful entry of an employee's record in the system's dataset, his face will be detected by its name, and his attendance will be marked. After a particular time (depending on the organisation), for example, half an hour, the employee receives a confirmation email for the same. The proposed work provides efficient data management at the end of the Admin.",

Under the policy of moving the country towards 'Thailand 4.0', the Thai government has placed importance on value-based economy and innovation driven economy. The empirical analyses, based on the national innovation system (NIS) approach, have shown that the Thai government plays a key role in building a crowd funding platform to provide entrepreneurial finance for start-ups. The findings point out the barriers both at the policy and operation levels underlying the Thai financial innovation system. The paper provides insightful lessons and implications to strengthen the FinTech crowd funding platform for promoting knowledge intensive economic growth.",

Industries are shifting their ways and workings in accordance to adapt to this flow and gain market share by fully utilising their core competencies. Engagement in continuous redesigning is required for both technology and business artefacts for the organisations who want to improve and build their digital abilities (Westerman et al., 2014). This paper aims to explore the transformation of business models (revenue models) due to digitalisation. It includes the impact of digital disruption and its scale of disruption on the industry, its reach, and richness of experience. We developed an integrated framework by a combination of RPV framework, strategy diamond and business model canvas to study the impact of digitalisation on the revenue streams. The Indian market is experiencing changes in different forms and intensities, be it a regulatory framework or the work culture. This paper further includes case analysis of the impact of digitalisation on different industries including e-commerce, retail and banking. Further benefits of the research include the application of the integrated framework to study the shift in revenue due to any major amendment or invention in the industry as pre- and post-effects.",

  "abstract": "The effective detection of distributed denial of service is still a challenging task and the impact of such attacks is usually harmful. According to recent studies, there has been a perception that machine learning can have remarkable impact on network security, mainly in network traffic analysis. It is useful to study and analyse network traffic behaviour consistently using large and real time datasets and train them to build a network model using advanced machine learning techniques. These techniques are capable of detecting both known and unknown attacks. Here, we propose a hybrid classifier model which can detect both known and unknown attacks by using two stage classifiers. The results obtained on benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed model is a highly useful classifier for detecting different types of transmission control protocol flooding-based distributed denial of service attacks with a reduced number of false positives.",

  "abstract": "Project-based organisations are facing real-time challenges such as cost overrun, handle deviations and communication gaps to meet the customer requirements. Projects mostly do not have real-time information on labour and material shortage. From the literature, it is identified that project-driven supply chain (PDSC) activities comprise of both on-field activities (i.e., resource and equipment planning, work assignment), and off-site activities (i.e., manufacturing, transportation, and material stocking). Thus, it is imperative to make both on-field and off-site project community are connected to drive the work alignment and ensure to minimise project disruption. The IoT technology bridges the gaps in the current PDSC and assists enterprises for better project planning and implementation. The objective of the paper is to discuss the opportunities that exist with IoT technology for project-driven supply chain organisations in the Industry 4.0 environment. A case study is performed in a project-based organisation. Based on the study, recommendations are given to stakeholders to deploy IoT to track material shortages in real-time and make timely decisions, reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve worker's safety with technology. Overall, IoT embedded PDSC connects the project community in real-time and improves project performance to deliver customer commitments.",

  "abstract": "The notion of organisation agility has gained prominent attention from scholars and practitioners since 1991. Over the years, the idea of organisation agility has evolved, becoming a managerial paradigm applicable to various functional units across different industries with accomplished results. However, the heterogeneity and diversity in the studies make the recent organisation agility literature diverse and fragmented, and an extensive analysis of the contributions in this field is lacking. To address this gap, the authors propose an integrative literature review. Furthermore, to trace the knowledge taxonomy, this will be the first bibliometric study for the concerned subject matter, thus, adding to its relevance and uniqueness. The scrutiny of the studies unveiled that agility has been investigated across different dimensions, with managers striving to identify the relevant elements and assessment models for agility. Besides, three significant themes, including organisation agility, the role of IT and integration and collaboration in enhancing agility, and workforce agility, emerged through bibliometric analysis.",

  "abstract": "Technology transfer (TT) from public research organisations (PROs) is increasingly recognised as a key mechanism to facilitate economic impacts. Given its economic relevance, scholars are increasingly trying to understand TT success and its determinants. However, TT success is not well defined, and the literature on determinants remains fragmented. We investigate the goals and determinants of TT across research institutes (RIs) and universities within the New Zealand (NZ) ecosystem from the perspective of senior TT professionals who facilitate processes at the intersection between government, university, and industry sectors. We adopt a qualitative, inductive case approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 11 senior TT professionals across five RIs and six universities. Our findings indicate that TT success goals and determinants are largely shared across the two types of PROs, with some contextual differences emergent. TT success is defined temporally by short-and long-term goals, with PROs emphasising longer-term outcomes over short-term outputs and returns. Determinants for TT success fall under two dimensions: managing internal resources and acquiring external resources, with determinants spanning individual, organisational, and system levels. Finally, we combine the findings to form a model which provides an empirical framework for future studies.",

This study explores the dynamics of crowdfunding and FinTech challenges of Thailand. The paper specifically analyses FinTech crowdfunding, the latest peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for fund transfer under digital transformation. The empirical analyses of Thailand 4.0 policy, based on the national innovation system (NIS) approach, have shown that the Thai Government plays a key role in building a crowdfunding platform to promote entrepreneurship. The Thai Government attempts to endorse Thailand 4.0 policy to drive the nation towards the value-based economy and innovation driven economy. The findings point out the barriers both at the policy and operation levels underlying the Thai entrepreneurial innovation system. The study offers insightful lessons and implications to strengthen the crowdfunding platform for promoting knowledge-intensive economic growth.",

  "abstract": "A significant challenge in the development of automatic vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is the distinguishing features between the different shapes based on the appearance of objects. The automatic recognition of vehicles based on their geometric shapes is in high demand. The diversity of make and model of vehicles further complicates this process. There are few applications that can recognise vehicles based on their geometric shape. To bridge this gap, convolution neural network (CNN) was adopted to predict the make and model of a car from either the rear view or front view of the vehicle using the pre-trained MobileNet. First, YOLOV3 has been used to detect the vehicle. The colour and the license plate of the vehicles are also extracted. An accuracy of 94.1% in the recognition of make of cars, 98.7% for the model, 99.1% for car plate registration number, and 90.3% for the colour was achieved.",

  "abstract": "Assets are significant parts of supply chains. On the other hand, Islamic banking is called asset-backed due to Islamic financial concepts, so the supply chain flows of the assets in normal, conventional and Islamic finance scenarios are different. However, studies are scarce in this regard. Therefore, the study's purpose is to elaborate on the supply chain flows of the assets in normal, conventional, and Islamic financing scenarios. This is a conceptual paper, which uses the library research method and participant observation background of the principal researcher. This study found three propositions that show Islamic banks have a unique stake in the supply chain flows of their financed assets. They are not only stakeholders in the financial and informational supply chain flows, but they must be considered the stakeholders in the ownership supply chain flow. This point makes them different from conventional financers as well as different from the normal supply chain flows of the assets. This study will support making a win-win situation for supply chain entities.",

  "abstract": "Graph embedding is one of the vital technologies in solving the problem of information overload in recommendation systems. It can simplify the vector representations of items and accelerates the calculation process. Unfortunately, the recommendation system using graph embedding technology does not consider the deep relationships between items when it learns embedding vectors. In order to solve this problem, we propose a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on DeepWalk and self-attention in this paper. This algorithm can enhance the accuracy in measuring the similarity between items and obtain more accurate embedding vectors. Chronological order and mutual information are used to construct a weighted directed relationship graph. Self-attention and DeepWalk are utilised to generate embedding vectors. Then item-based collaborative filtering is utilised to obtain recommended lists. The result of the relative experiments and evaluations on three public datasets shows that our algorithm is better than the existing ones.",

In recent years, the incidence of attacks with rogue BTS has risen unexpectedly, primarily in nations where GSM remains the primary telecommunications infrastructure. Using YateBTS as the BTS software, we simulated an attack scenario with IMSI catcher, calls/SMS spoofing and calls/SMS interception. Using forensic software such as EnCase and FTK, we examined Raspberry OS (a Linux-based operating system) and YateBTS. We gathered and recovered important artefacts related to user activity, user authentication activity, system calls messages from Blade RF, call logs, internet traffic log, custom SMS and BTS configurations that would be useful in a court of law. We can reconstruct the truth of the crime using the artefacts recovered. Law enforcement, computer forensic investigators, and the digital forensics research community will benefit greatly from the findings of this study.",

  "abstract": "The dark web has emerged as a platform where cybercriminals carry out illegal activities. Attempts to investigate and de-anonymise the suspicious dark web users have not been able to keep up with the pace of the dark web's flourishing coupled with dysfunctional tools and techniques. This study proposes and evaluates a dark web investigation framework using a Python-based tool to harvest data from the dark web to derive intelligence for further investigation using the available opensource intelligence (OSINT) tools. In the experimental implementation of the framework and the tool (Dark2Clear), the tool successfully scraped the hidden service URLs, harvested the e-mail addresses of the dark web users, and suspicious e-mail addresses were used as input to the OSINT tools for gathering intelligence to de-anonymise. It was observed that the framework and tool can be effectively used by the investigators to investigate and de-anonymise suspicious dark web users.",

  "abstract": "In digital signal processors, computation intensive arithmetic functions such as image smoothing, convolution and filtering frequently involve multiplication-based operations like inner-product generation and accumulation. Multiplication time is the predominate element in determining the execution time of any digital signal processing chip. Switching activity of the functional units in the multiplier contributes to significant amount of power dissipation. This paper presents high speed energy efficient multiplier. By reducing the switching activity and number of computations, the proposed multiplier achieves a better performance in terms of delay and PDP. The proposed high speed energy efficient multiplier is designed using Verilog-HDL and synthesised using Cadence RTL compiler with respect to 180 nm and 90 nm technological libraries. The proposed multiplier shows the delay reduction of 8.95% to 31.40%. The potential benefit of reducing the delay realises a PDP reduction of 13.66% to 26.95%. The performance of the proposed multiplier is verified by implementing it in 16 tap 16-bit coefficient band pass finite impulse response filter. The multiplier used here can be used in signal processing application to obtain energy efficient hardware.",

This study examines cloud nomenclature in the meteorological local region to aid numerical weather forecast. Numerical weather prediction forecasts weather. Numerous machine-learning methods are suggested for numerical weather prediction equation evaluation (NWP). Despite these inaccuracies, the methodologies so far provide decent results. It is hard to manage weather history, but it is best to do so. Thus, we propose a novel k-nearest neighbour classifier to prune missing values. Despite these inaccuracies, the methodologies so far provide decent results. The new KNN, optimum k-nearest neighbour, uses an enhanced way to choose out the precise data required for prediction. Seattle rainfall datasets assess performance. We found that the optimum KNN method improves classification accuracy while reducing time.",

  "abstract": "Big data revolution emerged with greater opportunities as well as challenges. Some of the major challenges include capturing, storing, transferring, analysing, processing and updating these large and complex datasets. Traditional data handling techniques cannot manage this fast growing data. Apache Hadoop is one of the best technologies which can address the challenges involved in big data handling. Hadoop is a centralised, distributed data storage model. InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) is an emerging technology which can provide a decentralised distributed storage. By integrating both these technologies, we can create a better framework for the distributed storage and processing of big data. In the proposed work, we formulated a model for big data placement, replication and processing by combining the features of Hadoop and IPFS. Hadoop distributed file system and IPFS jointly handle the data placement and replication tasks and the programming framework MapReduce in Hadoop handle the data processing task. The experimental result shows that the proposed framework can achieve cost-effective storage as well as faster processing of big data.",

The purpose of this is to make the extracted features nonlinear and to be able to learn more complex knowledge. The improved LSTM network is introduced to make a short-term forecast of wind power load. The dataset used in this experiment is the foreign GEFcom2014-Load wind power dataset. Because the dimension units of the 24-dimensional impact indicators in the dataset are different, in order to eliminate the dimensional impact between the indicators, the data is normalised in the experiment by adopting the min-max standardisation method. The experimental results show that the training error, validation error, and test error of the improved method are all reduced by 1%, 18% and 16%, compared with the second, third, and fourth groups.",

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust model for recognising the context of a conversation by using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Initially, the pre-processed text is passed to an embedding layer, which gives out a feature matrix. This is passed to a multi-level CNN. In the proposed model, each CNN reduces the input matrix to half of the input size. Thus, the output of the next CNN layer and the pass of the current CNN layer followed by average pooling are added. The output from the last CNN layer and global outputs are concatenated and finally, passed into two fully connected layers FC(512) and FC(8). In the proposed paper, context is classified into categories like spiritual-mythological, healthcare, trade-commerce, politics, personal, academic, sports, and violence. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms with an accuracy of 92.97%. We compared the performance of our model to conventional ML algorithms and obtained promising results.",

  "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of classification of hyperspectral remote sensing image and detection of any changes in the land use pattern using it. Traditional pixel-based classification approaches often fail to achieve acceptable accuracy in classifying Landsat images because of its complexity. Therefore, the present work aims to apply object-based image analysis (OBIA), which is a concept that combines segmentation and classification together into one unit. We propose a hybrid OBIA architecture, augmented with particle swarm optimisation (PSO) technique to fine tune different hyperparameters involved with it. We present its success on a classification problem where two sets of Landsat-8 images captured in the year 2016 and 2017 are considered as input and OBIA is applied for classifying the images into four major land use classes and detect any changes in these classes over a period of time. The results are then compared with best pixel-based classification approach known as random forest (RF) classifier to determine its effectiveness in classification of hyperspectral images. Statistical measures like precision, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are used as a parameter for comparison.",

  "abstract": "A focus group discussion on halal procurement strategy was conducted with food multinationals. The focus group discussion illustrated that leading halal procurement strategies are founded on solid halal risk and reputation management; harmonise, standardise and simplify halal; backup plans for halal critical items purchasing; local suppliers of halal critical items; all suppliers of halal critical items need to be halal certified; business contingency plans by suppliers; and leveraging synergy advantages. There is a preference for local or regional sourcing instead of global sourcing, and a preference for multiple sourcing, instead of single sourcing. The substance of relationship between buyer and supplier evolves based on the maturity of a supplier relationship. Monitoring and evaluation of halal critical suppliers require a combination of vendor rating, benchmarking, and physical audits. There is potential for collaborative purchasing with purchasing organisations both within and outside their own group of companies. As halal procurement is a new field of research, further qualitative research has been recommended.",

  "abstract": "The development of financial technology in Indonesia in general has increased exponentially during the last decade. In particular, the rapid and massive e-wallet promotion offered by several prominent vendors has raised new opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to increase sales revenue. In addition, e-wallet use has boosted the enthusiasm of consumers through various discounted prices. Few studies on the attitudes of owners or managers of SMBs on financial technology have examined deeply the factors that influence the adoption of the e-wallet in SMBs. This research uses a technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework to focus on internal and external characteristics of SMBs. Data from 402 respondents were analysed using SEM-PLS. The findings suggested that vendors offering e-wallet payment services should consider their perceived usefulness and ease of use. Government support has also shown to be a significant antecedent toward consumers' intention to use e-wallet payment services in Indonesian SMBs.",

  "abstract": "Security of assets is foremost and vigorous, should it be hardware, software, or a digital piece of information, an organisation should protect its assets. When the security of computer systems is discussed, several different branches are identified that need and deserve the advanced level of security. Network security is among the prominent sector and is considered today's topmost branch of computers which is at utmost risk and danger. It acts as a bridge between the different micro, mini, and advanced sized computer systems connectivity from different parts of the world. One of the most common and unsophisticated ways to secure digital information is intrusion detection systems (IDSs). The IDS plays a significant and pivotal role in securing networks. This work comprises a comparison on well-known, three open-source IDS named Snort, Suricata, Bro/Zeek. Extensive comparison will be performed based on 12 different yet interconnected standards. It will help an individual to better understand which technology is best suited for its network. A matrix has been designed through which five different experiments were executed based on which the juxtaposition will be prepared. This paper summarises an extensive study of several researchers with a practical experiment approach in a well-controlled environment.",

  "abstract": "The success of global supply chain management often rests on the information sharing capabilities of trading partners in the global business network. As such, inter-organisational collaboration, which can facilitate cross-organisational information sharing, is essential for global supply chain management. To enhance inter-organisation collaboration, multinational firms (MNFs) should nurture corporate culture that encourages the real-time exchanges of business intelligence about foreign markets and customer behaviours through a series of information and communication technology (ICT). One of the useful tools for creating such culture is an inter-organisational decision support system (IODSS) that can coordinate and synchronise the flow of information across the global supply chain, while increasing business intelligence capabilities. As such, today's DSS should undergo dramatic metamorphoses on a global scale. This paper synthesises the evolution of IODSS over the last few decades, develops a basic architecture of IODSS, and then suggests practical guidelines for its successful implementation in global business environments.",

  "abstract": "With the advent of 5G communication networks, the number of devices on the core 5G network significantly increases.A5Gnetwork is a cloud native, massively connected internet of things (IoT) platform with a huge number of devices hosted on the network now known as massive machine type communication (mMTC). As ultra-low latency is pivotal in developing 5G communication, a proper cell association scheme is now required to meet the load and traffic needs of the new network, opposed to older cell association schemes which were based only on the reference signal received power (RSRP). This paper proposes an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, namely hidden Markov model (HMM) learning on the network's telemetry data, which is used to learn network parameters and select the best eNodeB for cell association. The proposed model uses an HMM learning followed by decoding for selecting the optimal cell for association.",

  "abstract": "A significant proportion of fresh products either does not reach the market due to quality deterioration or reaches the consumer in poor condition raising concerns about marketing and public health. Latest advances in sensing and communication technologies in agriculture and agri-food supply chain, facilitate traceability, monitoring the products throughout the whole supply chain, starting from in-field production and through all steps of transportation, processing, and marketing. In this work, an IoT-based web and android-based platform is proposed which will monitor and guarantee the quality of the fresh products through a traceability system. The system supports enhanced communication between sellers and traders and includes all the significant steps from the farm to the storage, processing, packaging, transportation and placement at the store's shelf and the final receiver, the consumer. Thus, this work contributes with new knowledge, providing an overview of the design of integrated system for advanced traceability of fresh produce.",

  "abstract": "Freedom of expression and speech is widely misused in social media today. Unfortunately, the content shared on these platforms contains abusive content which is in multiple forms. This humongous amount of text requires automated detection of abusive language. This is a challenging problem because of a lot of noise, large vocabulary, context-dependency, and multilingualism. Deep learning (DL) models are being used due to the inefficiency of regular expressions, blacklists, and machine learning approaches. Hence, we have used neural language models for extracting high-quality features from the text. This paper demonstrates the usage of the natural language processing (NLP) model, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers commonly called BERT to perform various classification techniques. We have presented the results of fine-tuning the BERT pre-trained model for abusive language detection. The empirical analysis of offensive language identification and toxic comment classification datasets showed that these architectures achieved better results than existing models.",

The existing literature works fail to provide a user-friendly mobile application for cultivation as well as machine learning-based crop recommendation by taking different factors into account. This paper creates a mobile application that enables farmers to forecast viable crops based on climate factors like humidity, rainfall, and temperature as well as soil characteristics. The suggested model is used to forecast agricultural production using crop records of diverse crops with various properties of soil and climate parameters. The suggested model offers farmers a comprehensive list of recommendations to help them choose crops that are best for them based on particular considerations like production costs and fertiliser recommendations. The user's feedback shows satisfactory remarks in terms of its usefulness.",

For ethics learning, it can facilitate free exchanges of ideas in a judgement-free environment and effectively arouse participants' interest and inquiry of ethics. In a community college in Hong Kong, two ethics seminars were shifted from face-to-face to face-to-screen mode due to COVID-19 pandemic. They were blended with a popular SRS, Poll Everywhere, to facilitate opinion sharing. Other than verbal discussion, students participated by casting their choices about some ethical dilemmas in real-time through Poll Everywhere. Post-activity survey reflected that the approach of adopting SRS in online ethics learning facilitated participants to express their views, increased participants' engagement and provided participants psychological safety to share opinions. The learning mode contains the nature of both interactivity and sincere sharing, and hence is specifically fit for ethics education.",

For that, a systematic literature review was conducted using the Scopus database. First, a network analysis of keywords was carried out. Next, the studies were read and their contributions systematised. The results show that, while the relationship between the themes is recognised, studies relating green information technology and circular economy as the main focus are limited. However, from the analysed studies, it was possible to develop a conceptual framework integrating the circular economy and green information technology. This work brings theoretical contributions by systematising knowledge about an emerging theme and developing a conceptual framework describing the application of circular practices in the management of green information technology. Besides, it is useful for business managers looking for insights concerning the minimisation of environmental impacts generated by information technology.",

With growing data processing and data analytic techniques, big data provides significant benefits to organisations and individuals by improving productivity and enriching people's life. However, security and privacy are big concerns for big data applications. While a large quantity of data is collected, securely storing, processing and using the data are challenging. In this paper, we propose a four-factor framework for big data security and privacy in business information systems. The proposed framework addresses big data security and privacy issues in terms of collecting the right data, collecting the right amount of data, protecting the data in the right way, and using the data for the right purposes. We present a set of approaches and models for each of the four factors to improve big data security and privacy.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing (CC) is a popular paradigm with dynamic capabilities where statistics are maintained, managed, and backed up remotely. It allows consumers as well as corporations over a web network to use the services as per demand and requirement and increases the competences of the hardware resources by optimal and shared utilisation. However, information security and privacy have become a crucial issue that affects the triumph of CC. First and foremost, information storage at cloud builds the risk of information leak and illegal access. Second, cloud servers are turning into the objectives of assaults and interruptions which challenge cloud security. Third, information management tasks, like, information storage, reinforcement, migration, removal, update, exploration, query and admittance in the cloud may not be completely trusted by its proprietors. Therefore, to enhance security, a hybrid security technique for CC using a probabilistic approach has been proposed. The proposed framework facilitates the cloud consumer with information security reassurance. Our elucidation is built on 'hybrid probabilistic triple (RSA and AES) encryption' approach and this methodology is used to encode-decode the information before porting on a cloud with a hash value of each and delivers the data integrity, confidentiality and user authenticity, along with, a review of different privacy and security issues is also discussed.",

  "abstract": "The study analyses the state of the art on environmental accounting in the public sector, highlighting the evolution of literature and providing ideas for future research advances on the topic. The article is based on a systematic literature review, developed according to the PRISMA protocol to ensure scientific rigour within the data search, selection, analysis, and interpretation process. The findings highlight that the research on environmental accounting in the public sector is still limited, albeit showing an increasing trend. Future research might deepen the link between the implementation of environmental accounting practices and the economic-financial performance of public companies. The limits of the study have a methodological nature, being linked to the adoption of the systematic literature review: brief time span, restrained number of evidence, inclusions of only journal articles, and absence of the risk of bias assessment. The article contributes to the enrichment and updating of the state of the art given that to date there are no studies that carry out a systematic literature review on the topic of environmental accounting in the public sector.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning and data mining help companies to build a tool that can make and take actions based on customer knowledge and information. Customer information is the base of maintaining long term relationship with customers and also known as customer relationship and management (CRM). Classification and segmentation of customer data set is utilised to maintain efficient relation with customers and subsequently increase the profitability and productivity. In this paper, author proposed customer segmentation based on demographic properties like gender, age and spending score and analysed the data set for interesting fact. The derived attribute data set is investigated for classification. Classification is used to categorise each customer into a number of classes, i.e., 'gold', 'silver', 'elite' and 'occasional'. Comparison of different classification algorithm is simulated by WEKA tool. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is found as the best classification algorithm with an accuracy of 98.33% compared to Naïve Bayes, regression and J48.",

  "abstract": "Online learning is raging due to the offered advantages including the ease of information accessibility and flexible learning experiences remotely. However, it still lacks intelligent authentication and validation of users at the other end. Additional questions are raised for the effectiveness of transfer of knowledge, soft skills, and value of education as the student's engagement. Following the hype and crucial need for full-fledged virtual learning environments (VLEs) in recent times, the literature has witnessed a significant increase in the studies targeting the associated problem areas. The existing VLEs in place fail to provide aggregated functionalities of student authentication and activity tracking in dynamic visual environments. To solve the problem by providing interactive functionality, an automated hybrid information activity system (HIAS) based on facial biometrics, facial emotion recognition using computer vision techniques is proposed. The proposed system solves the problem intelligently by analysing the incoming online video from the tutor's computer screen.",

  "abstract": "Coronavirus pandemic in 2020 posed new challenges for supply chains, requiring a rethinking of risk assessment approaches, with a focus on post-pandemic recovery and SC's ability to adapt to new business conditions. This study is aimed at performing a descriptive and comparative analysis of the potential risks of supply chains in a number of countries, as well as at assessing the processes of their integration into global supply chains based on the Global Resilience Index FM 2020 as a parameter of resilience of an entity to disruptive events, which fully meets the requirements for a comprehensive assessment of supply chain risks. According to the findings, when formulating a supply chain risk management strategy, the focus should be on an analysis of the external environment and the sustainability of the supply chain. The results and methods of this study can be applied by top managers of supply chain risk management, while government officials can use the results and methods of this article to determine policy for supply chain management.",

  "abstract": "Recommender systems have impressively hit the e-commerce industry in the last few years. With the increased use of recommender systems, the risk of preventing the authentic and true data has also been increased. Many algorithms have been proposed by various researchers to detect and prevent an attack, in recent years. But presently, no algorithm exists as a complete solution to this issue because of one or other constraints. The research in the paper intends to provide a solution to this issue and proposes a framework of more secured collaborative recommender system as compared to conventional recommender systems. The proposed framework uses the approach of Turing test to identify any robotic involvement and does not allow insertion of ratings from such non-human users. Ratings from real users are allowed, collected and examined. Textual opinions are also collected while collecting the ratings. Opinion mining is performed on given textual opinion to identify and discard push and nuke ratings. Valid ratings are stored in the database for generating recommendations for items. The paper also examines the effect of push and nuke ratings on performance by evaluating the accuracy of a recommender system using various measure metrics.",

The future use of systematic instruments could support the development of long-term, socially sustainable urban projects that attract cultural tourism, promote a better life and activate civic participation. The toolbox approach highlights the issue of Intellectual Property (IP) protection. A directory that shows who owns what provides idea/trademark owners with a potential reference point to find out about their rights and the extent to which these rights are being used. This could be particularly helpful in those jurisdictions where proof of first use or genuine use is required. Block chain technology can also play an important role in the context of unregistered IP rights, as it can provide evidence of their conception, use, qualification requirements, and the country of origin.",

  "abstract": "The 21st century is characterised by grand challenges, external shocks and global fragilities, such as economic volatility and societal upheaval in our interconnected communities. International business managers must adapt to consider geopolitics as relevant to their activities, to integrate political risk analyses into their business decisions. International society is in need of content-sensitive orientation knowledge to reassess, adjust and accommodate diplomacy's essentials (human factor interactions) to new expectations of the public sphere. In a qualitative leap towards a change of mindset, decision-makers should learn to think and act responsibly through the middle of conflictual situations towards compromise and consensus, thus managing politics through diplomacy. Transnational corporations can profit from traditional state diplomacy in order to create a reliable working environment and to anticipate and avoid costly conflicts, if they practice Corporate Diplomacy as a key concept of trusted and coordinated collaboration with government and local host communities. Corporations adhering to the diplomatic communication tool of Corporate Diplomacy are also gaining legitimacy and political influence over the development of societies.",

The proposed algorithm is more useful in the case of the client and server-based interaction like in the case of wireless mobile internet (4G/LTE) usage by an individual and in the case of bank transactions that are made by the individuals. Security, resistance to side attacks and collisions, larger key size, and non-factorisation of the prime numbers are the advantages of the RSA which is used in the proposed algorithm. Synthesis and implementation of the encrypted block have been compared and analysed on Spartan-3, Spartan-6e, Virtex-4 and Spartan-6 FPGA boards. Complete security is achieved using digital signature and previous problems of the traditional algorithm.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Grid and Utility Computing",
  "abstract": "Real-world supply chain network is complex due to large problem size and constraints. An optimum petroleum products scheduling would not only influence the distribution cost but also result in optimal product scheduling. The bio-inspired method is preferred alternative to exact algorithms because it does not require prior knowledge of the initial solution unlike the latter. The study proposes an improved African Buffalo Optimisation (ABO) algorithm for petroleum supply chain distribution. The ABO is a swarm intelligence-based bio-inspired algorithm with significant performance track record. It models the grazing and defending lifestyle of the African buffaloes in the savannah. The chaotic ABO and chaotic-Levy ABO are the ABO's improved variants with outstanding performance in recent studies. The present study applies the standard ABO and its improved variants to obtain a near optimum petroleum distribution scheduling solution. The comparative result shows that the proposed approach outperformed existing exact algorithms.",

  "abstract": "The original principle of removing elements of a mathematical model based on its parametric identification of neural network is proposed in the paper. The essence of proposed method is to find a functional subset with less variable results and higher accuracy than for the initial functional set of the model. It allows reducing the computational and time complexity of the applications built on the model. The comparison with dropout technique shows the 1, 1 decreasing of root mean squared error. In addition, reducing the complexity allows increasing the accuracy of neural network models. Therefore, reducing the number of parameters is an essential step in data preprocessing used in almost all modern systems. However, known methods of reducing the dimension depend on the problem area, making it impossible to use them in ensemble models.",

This paper seeks to analyse if the funds available from CSR can act as an instrument for companies to contribute to SDG needs. The study of 60 Indian companies compares prescribed vs. actual CSR expenditure, the geographical and thematic spread of activities, and compliance towards specific provisions of the companies act. Our critical findings in the paper are that the business awareness of SDG has increased, and the pool of CSR funds has increased post-2014. There is a narrow focus on four thematic areas of education, healthcare, hunger, and poverty alleviation. The geographical spread of fund expenditure is limited to a few key states in India. And, while the reporting quality on CSR and sustainability efforts has improved, there is a long way to go to comply with the Act.",

Our study aimed to assess the mental health difficulties and influence of lockdown stressors among Indian higher education students' and employees of the government, private sector during the COVID-19 lockdown. We collected the basic demographic, sleep generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), perceived stress scale (PSS) and sleep quality data from 676 participants using a web-based cross-sectional survey. Among the participants, the overall prevalence of GAD and PSS were 22.9%, 15.7% (low), 79.4% (medium), 4.7 (high), respectively. Younger participants reported higher GAD and PSS symptoms. Lockdown stressors have a significant correlation with GAD and PSS. In addition, the increased mobile phone usage significantly affects sleep latency, and sleep quality (p < 0.001) is a subject of concern. As part of global preparedness measures, continuous monitoring of sleep and the psychological impacts of outbreaks should become standard practice.",

  "abstract": "Imbalanced datasets typically make prediction accuracy difficult. Most of the real-world data are imbalanced in nature. The traditional classifiers assume a well-balanced class distribution for training data but in practical datasets show up an imbalance, thus obscure a classifier and degrade its capability to learn from such imbalanced datasets. Data pre-processing approaches address this concern by using either random undersampling or oversampling techniques. In this paper, we introduce Earth mover's distance (EMD), as a similarity measure, to find the samples similar in nature and eliminate them as redundant from the dataset. Earth mover's distance has received a lot of attention in wide areas such as computer vision, image retrieval, machine learning, etc. The Earth mover's distance-based undersampling approach provides a solution at the data level to eliminate the redundant instances in majority samples without any loss of valuable information. This method is implemented with five conventional classifiers and one ensemble technique respectively, like C4.5 decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB) and AdaBoost technique. The proposed method yields a superior performance on 21 datasets from Keel repository.",

They often ignored low level operations and their timing optimisation. As a result, a lot of these manufacturers suffer from inefficient and uncoordinated operations. Bottleneck would inevitably occur at some stages of the production, which caused the work-in-process goods to build up everywhere in the production plant. This paper used a simulation approach to analyse the low level manufacturing operations in details with the objective to identify the bottleneck and resolve the work-in-process inventory problem, without production out degradation.",

  "abstract": "With the evolution of automation and Industry 4.0, there has been a drastic revolution in the fields of manufacturing supply chains. This has even given rise to global competition and supply chain complexities as well. In the world of information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a major role in running the things with ease and access. The main focus of this study will be on the Indian automobile supply chains (IASCs), where the implementation of AI will be suggested by framing a functional model through well-structured 'DMAIC' approach, without ignoring the barrier and driver factors, prevailing in Indian supply chain environments. The revolutionary define-measure-analyse-improve-control (DMAIC) strategy of Six Sigma is well tested for its 'defect reduction' aspects and also evolved as a strong 'problem-solving tool' from last couple of decades. In the present study, DMAIC's efficacy is tested for providing a feasible AI deployment model for Indian automobile supply chains.",

This type of lighting is different from traditional, stationary illumination, or dimmable street lighting that dims at predetermined times. Intelligent street lighting, also referred to as adaptive street lighting, dims when no activity is detected, but brightens when movement is detected. Apart from that in this model of intelligent street lighting the lights will be configured to interact with each other to inform further lights to turn on or off when activity is detected near them. This ensures that people always walk in well-lit areas but area where activity is not detected remains dark thus saving energy. The lights will also be fitted with sensors to detect available sunlight initially and only come into action when required instead of predetermined times, it will also have access to a web API that provides average sunrise and sunset times in the region to save energy by reducing usage of the sensor itself.",

The study used the 2020 FM Global Resilience Index as an indicator of relative enterprise resilience to disruptive events, which fully meets the requirements for a comprehensive assessment of supply chain risks. The overall analysis included different countries occupying various positions in the FM Global Resilience Index. When forming a strategy for supply chain risk management, the central attention is to be given to the analysis of the external environment and supply chain resilience. Current tendencies toward globalisation necessitate the consideration of supply chain resilience in the global context. Political risks, corruption, poor cybersecurity, and supply chain visibility play an essential role in assessing the resilience index and analysing the external environment.",

  "abstract": "In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), nodes are connected by multihop wireless connections and topology is changing very frequently due to movement of nodes. Therefore, it leads to the need of efficient dynamic routing protocols. Many routing protocols have been proposed for communication in dynamic environments and it is observed that multipath routing protocols are more preferred over the single path routing protocols in terms of many network parameters such as delay, energy consumption etc. These protocols are designed to fulfil the requirements of communication in the network. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to determine the difference between multipath routing protocols when operating in large-area MANETs with the help of constant bit rate, and variable bit rate data-traffic patterns; and these traffic patterns applied on the network with the different speeds and varying simulation pause time. This paper tests the performance of the following multipath protocols AOMDV, BAOMDV, BAMR, and LLECP-AOMDV on the NS-2 network platform.",

  "abstract": "In order to solve the problems of low prediction accuracy and long prediction time existing in traditional methods for predicting the economic benefits of market digital transformation, a method for predicting the economic benefits of market digital transformation based on federal learning algorithm is proposed. Obtain the prediction indicators and build a prediction indicator system for the economic benefits of market digital transformation. Pre-process the indicator data using the principal component analysis method, build a sample dataset, build a federal optimisation algorithm using the random gradient descent method, establish a minimum loss function, build a prediction model for the economic benefits of market digital transformation, and output the prediction results. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method can reach more than 95%, and the prediction time is always kept within 3 s, with good prediction effect and efficiency.",

In this paper, we offer a smart integrated system composed of a number of buoys that are dispersed in the sea and are equipped with suites of sensors that can measure a variety of vital environmental, biological and chemical parameters. The system is a comprehensive and interactive multi-parameter monitoring structure with two-way communication through a wireless mobile network that implements machine learning to detect and categorise the various parameters. In pursuing so, four contemporary algorithms are applied and compared, namely: logistic regression, naïve Bayes, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machines. The experimental findings reveal that the support vector machine performs remarkably well, with best accurate classification rate of 86% with the corresponding weighted average precision, recall, F-score, and MMC of 0.86, 0.86, 0.858, and 0.84, respectively.",

  "abstract": "Critical infrastructures are vital assets for public safety, economic welfare or national security of countries. The importance of critical infrastructures necessitates state-level coordination of security efforts based on some rigid policies, strategies, and procedures. This hierarchical set of rules is collectively referred to as the critical infrastructure protection program (CIPP). As the pioneer of CIPP, the USA has a very complex program in which partners and stakeholders have multiple and varied interacting roles and responsibilities. The complexity of roles and interactions creates a need to make a representation of these complex structures by using intuitive tools. The Zachman framework is such a tool that provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining a complex enterprise. It is represented by a 6×6 matrix with rows defining stakeholders and columns defining underlying interrogatives. In this article, a proof-of-concept study is performed to represent the US CIPP using the Zachman framework. The proof-of-concept study showed that the Zachman framework could be beneficial in overcoming challenges of a CIPP program which can be regarded as a complex enterprise.",

These systems are applied in both formal and informal contexts. In this study, we carried out a systematic mapping with the aim of providing a more updated panorama of the state-of-the art, identifying gaps and future works in mobile and ubiquitous context awareness learning systems, especially in characteristics such as the most used entities in the context, adaptation of content, extraction of user information and gamification strategies that have been applied in an informal context. Our results show that the location and the user's profile are the entities of the most used context; that the most used type of adaptation is the adaptation of educational resources; that the gamification strategies allow to improve the learning experiences in the informal contexts; and that there are several studies aimed to extract user's information indirectly.",

For this purpose, data were collected from 328 external auditors in the Yemeni private and public sectors by using a questionnaire. The SmartPLS 3 has been used in analysing the data, based on the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Organisational support theory (OST) has been employed as an underpinning theory. The findings of the paper indicate a positive connection between organisational support, organisational culture and IT competency. This paper contributes to the current literature by recognising the supportive work environment-missing connections in the form of supervisory support and organisational support on IT competency for external auditors. The findings are, therefore, valuable for managers to develop organisational policies, procedures, and practices that support employee needs and then invest in training the employees.",

This paper is concerned with the label of the fourth industrial revolution, a term re-coined in 2016 by Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum. We aim to unravel the fourth industrial revolution by connecting such visions to concrete technological developments. First, we identified influential visionary individuals; second, we distilled the most promising technologies from their visions and, third, we traced these technologies back in research, development and innovation agendas of governments. As a fourth step we monitored the evolution of 33 promising technologies for the period 2000-2019 Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the promising technologies being mentioned in the visions of influential individuals, governments and science differ in priority and have a different meaning.",

A curriculum which evolves dynamically taking inputs from the external environment is essential as the innovation and disruption cycles tend to get shorter and the global skills gap tends to get larger. A data driven approach is suggested to develop an evolving curriculum aligned to the global trend of making management educational courses more responsible towards sustainability development. The United Nations Global Indicator framework for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is used to form a dictionary of sustainability related concepts and keywords using content analysis. This dictionary is then used as the data driven mechanism to evaluate the current sustainability orientation of a curriculum and identify the missing keyword and concept in the curriculum.",

In vehicular fog computing, a deep beacon power control (DBPC) protocol is utilised for the sending of the periodical message in the VANET. This algorithm increases the effectiveness in the coverage of the broadcast of safety and security-related information and satisfies the constraints on both the link state and delay. The induction of deep learning model in beacon power control approach aims to overcome the optimisation issue by improving the amount of a fading multiuser interference channel. VANET is one of the ad hoc network real-life applications for communication between near-by equipment such as roadside equipment and vehicles and between vehicles. The proposed technique leads to optimised data transmission in vehicular fog computing. Unnecessary network overhead and also channel congestion can be minimised using this proposed technique. The proposed deep BPC technique is implemented in both Keras and NS2 simulators. Outcomes of both simulations reveal that when deep learning embedded with BPC protocol, the performance increases rapidly.",

In some cases, these systems still cannot understand user intent which leads to the generation of inappropriate responses. Therefore, their inability to handle inappropriate responses has limited their utility in the real world. In this work, we propose a character deep learning model for the detection of chatbot quality of services to handle inappropriate responses by intelligently transferring the dialogue to a human agent. The proposed model has two goals: detect CQoS based on the sentiment score of the utterance using a deep learning model and transferring the user to a live agent when the utterance is inappropriate. The proposed model's effectiveness is evaluated on the dialogue breakdown detection task. The results of the experiment show that our proposed model is effective in achieving the desired goals.",

An in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art e-government services according to their suitability leads to the model of a smart tax authority. For this analysis, final application examples were shown for each individual departmental area. A further analysis about the bipolar requirements of citizen- and state-value was developed and revealed that most of the e-government services meet these requirements. By implementing the suggested ICT and services effectiveness and efficiency of the enforcement of tax laws can be increased, also mastering the bipolar challenges regarding citizen- and state-value.",

  "abstract": "This study inspects the effects of motivational factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) and leadership styles (transformational and transactional) on worker engagement in the ready-made garments industry of Bangladesh. The paper is based on Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory. The study adopted a quantitative technique and used SPSS to analyse the data assembled from a valid sample of 387 workers in Bangladesh's ready-made garments industry. The findings show that extrinsic motivational factors positively correlate with worker engagement more than intrinsic motivational factors. Consequently, transformational leadership is positively associated with worker engagement more than transactional leadership among the workers in the ready-made garments industry of Bangladesh. In conclusion, it is suggested that the industry should focus more on the transformational leadership style compared to the transactional leadership style and workers have to be motivated to increase productivity in this specific industry.",

  "abstract": "Different supervised machine learning algorithms' performance varies when applied to different datasets. Moreover, using a generalised supervised algorithm may not be able to produce the optimal performance as the nature of data is different for different datasets. In this paper, we used a pig breed dataset containing various statistical features extracted from individual pig images of five pig breeds. Eight well-established algorithms such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, decision trees, gradient boosted decision trees, random forest, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbours, and naïve Bayes are carefully applied to this dataset by tuning the necessary hyperparameters for each algorithm. The performance of all the applied algorithms is compared based on the micro averaged area under precision-recall (PR) and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves. From the results obtained, the SVM algorithm with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel has outperformed all the other algorithms with a pig breed prediction accuracy of 98%.",

  "abstract": "In Bangladesh, men and women are entering business not only to earn money but also to change their social conditions. Capital for conducting business is a big challenge for both male and female entrepreneurs. However, due to the lack of a proper loan eligibility system, both male and female entrepreneurs faced several problems regarding getting loans. Most entrepreneurs are unwilling to take loans from banks because their loan applications are rejected for various reasons. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, an automated recommendation system has been provided in a mobile application. This paper collects a real-time dataset for loan approval prediction systems. The system also develops a prediction model using machine learning algorithms that predict an entrepreneur's loan eligibility. The android application offers recommendations for a suitable bank for an eligible entrepreneur based on the prediction model and user data. The presented results confirm the necessity of our proposed system.",

  "abstract": "This systematic review aims at identifying the critical factors underpinning the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Sixty-five published articles that were meticulously scrutinised using qualitative inclusion/exclusion criteria were reviewed to determine the role of networking and the importance of knowledge, internal resources and institutional support to facilitate the internationalisation process of SMEs. Findings show that networking, knowledge, resources, and institutional support are central to the internationalisation of SMEs. Furthermore, it is recommended that comparative cross-country studies be carried out to determine the extent to which these factors are consistent across different countries. Future studies should adopt cross-disciplinary approach instead of using a fragmented approach. These findings have implications for multiple stakeholders (including, policymakers, banks, export promotion agencies, international network associations, and managers) in effectively strategising the internationalisation of SMEs. It sets directions for future studies to extend the body of knowledge on SMEs' internationalisation.",

This online survey resulted in 389 valid responses. The attitude towards using eLearning on social network sites was positive. The research found a statistically significant difference in the attitudes of both genders with the Thai males scoring higher than the Thai females though both were positive. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude for participants who had varied experiences using eLearning. Participants who were experienced in both formal and informal eLearning formats showed a more positive attitude towards eLearning on social network sites as opposed to participants who used either formal or informal eLearning formats only. This research findings shed light on a disruption to learning management systems in the era of social networking with implications beyond Thailand.",

  "abstract": "Differential evolution (DE) is popular as an optimisation technique for its ability to achieve a globally optimal solution in a non-convex fitness landscape. However, convergence rate of DE is still unsuitable for real-time applications. Hence, a new leader-centric learning algorithm based on DE named hybrid differential evolution with learning (HDEL) is proposed in this work to improve the convergence performance of DE. In the proposed scheme, the mutation and crossover strategy is supervised by the learning knowledge of the global best and global worst individual as well as the personal best of an individual in its current generation. Extensive simulations have been performed on a set of 44 mathematical benchmark functions and a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) planning problem. The results of the performance comparison of the proposed HDEL with other state-of-the-art algorithms confirm the significant improvement of HDEL in terms of optimum value, convergence speed, and computational complexity.",

A confirmatory research study was conducted to understand the ethical environment in the online academic community towards social media platforms, their usage, and time spent, social media habits and also the social media word-of-mouth influencing factors. In the present study, a model is framed based on the previous review and a field survey was conducted. A structured questionnaire was constructed having questions on demographic data, tools, social media usage and activities. Following a pilot study, the questionnaire was reframed. The main survey was conducted and data was collected from 300 samples from the academic community. Data analysis was done using IBM-SPSS 21.0. The result shows that the social media platform acts as a significant role in the ethical environment in the online academic community and also showed that individuals spend more than two hours accessing different social media. The study confirmed factors such as information usefulness, interactivity and credibility as the determinant for social media word-of-mouth.",

  "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to describe in a qualitative way, how Fijian auditors perceive the effects of COVID-19 on fraud and going-concern assessments during audit engagements. The data was analysed based on the responses of 12 professional auditors in Fiji. The findings reveal that auditing during COVID-19 involved a high level of data manipulation and financial hardship by many audit clients. Additionally, the findings suggest that auditors tend to apply a high degree of professional scepticism and judgement due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic. They also evaluate comprehensively the ability of the audit clients to operate indefinitely for the next 12 months before issuing an audit opinion. This study provides a preliminary impression of Fijian auditors' perception of the effect of COVID-19 on fraud and going-concern assessments.",

At present, the actual development effect of innovation and entrepreneurship education in China is not obvious. The innovation ability of college students needs to be improved, the proportion of innovation and entrepreneurship is still relatively low, and the success rate of entrepreneurship is not high. Therefore, we suggest that university libraries need to make full use of big data technology to better serve innovation and entrepreneurship education, thus effectively improving the effectiveness of innovation and entrepreneurship education, and facilitating the development of more innovative and entrepreneurial talents. Firstly, it expounds the connotation of innovation and entrepreneurship education, analyses the application of big data in university libraries, and secondly proposes the mechanism of cross-functional collaboration. Then, by integrating the independent data resources of university functional departments, the mechanism overcomes the problem of 'fragmentation'; finally, and innovatively proposed the establishment of new archives, and then through the means of big data for innovation and entrepreneurship education, and ultimately improve the quality of innovation and entrepreneurship education.",

The industry demands an intelligent system that can categorise the battlefield before generating texture for camouflaging their assets and objects, allowing them to adopt the conspicuous features of the scene. In this study, a CNN-based battlefield classification model has been developed to learn background information and classify the terrain. The study also intended to develop the texture for specific terrain by matching its salient features and boosting the effectiveness of the camouflage. Saliency maps have been used to measure the effectiveness of blending a camouflaged object into an environment.",

  "abstract": "Online marketing is a rising mode of selling products all over the world. E-shoppers use various modes of payment. This study explores and examines the factors which influence e-commerce users to adopt the cash on delivery (COD) mode of payment while shopping online. This is an empirical study done using data gathered from 387 Indian e-shoppers. This study reveals that the adoption of COD results from a sense of perceived security. Further, in online shopping perceived trust in vendors and payment systems, privacy and perceived safety from financial risk play a major role, as their presence leads to perceived security. This study is useful for marketers to understand the payment behaviour of e-shoppers in India and in the development of strategies, policies, and technologies to make a more secure e-shopping platform.",

  "abstract": "Credit card fraud - is the adversity complementary to a modern facile payment system. Over the years, credit card frauds have managed to cause massive losses to banks and credit companies globally. Where the extensive availability of data was envisaged to improve customer service, the fraudsters have managed to exploit this boon to amplify the volume, intensity, and value of frauds. While a complex and continually developing problem is hard to convey successfully using rule-based algorithms, machine-learning models present themselves as adept means of tackling the crisis. By combining supervised and unsupervised models, incorporating behavioural analytics and domain knowledge, and using artificial neural networks, fraudulent transactions detection is achievable with desirable accuracy and poses to be a promising tool for diminishing considerable losses.",

The study empirically tested the impact of five main indicators of financial inclusion on bank performance. Using a simple regression analysis, findings of the study showed statistically significant impact of two indicators of financial inclusion (i.e., financial access and enterprise financing) and bank financial performance (i.e., bank profitability) of Jordanian banks. The study recommends Jordanian financial institutions to move toward increasing innovative access to financial services as well as enhancing IT infrastructure and the development of financial services to raise the level of digital banking services which is currently considered relatively low when compared to other middle-income countries.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to show that the Bitcoin market is not isolated but is rather influenced by commodity markets in terms of return and volatility. We used the return of Bitcoin, crude oil, gold, silver and wheat for a period from 3 January 2011 to 22 November 2017. Based on the EGARCH model estimate, the main results indicated that Bitcoin return is positively but weakly influenced by returns of crude oil, gold, silver, and wheat. The results also show an inverse relationship between the volatility of crude oil and Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is a strong hedge against energy products. For gold, silver and wheat, the absence of risk transmission to the Bitcoin market suggests diversification opportunities following investors to use Bitcoin with any of the three assets to reduce the portfolio risk.",

For that purpose, a sample of 384 respondents was randomly selected from various Omani regions and universities. The study used mean values to rank the factors based on the students' responses following Friedman's test. In addition, factor analysis was also used to summarise these factors, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate any differences in the selection factors across genders and education levels. The findings revealed that the main factors for university selection are the academic and financial benefits and advantages closely followed by the quality and reputation of the universities. In addition, the findings revealed that there is a significant difference across education levels with regard to the perception of academic quality, accommodation, as well as reference to website advertisements. These findings have significant contributions to the Omani universities, as well universities in similar contexts. Particularly, it provides the universities with insights on the main dimensions and characteristics to emphasise in order to enhance their overall performance.",

  "abstract": "The manual approach to public procurement of works, goods, and services is characterised by many inefficiencies. To address these inefficiencies, public procuring entities globally adopt web-based e-procurement systems developed based on requirement models, for enhanced efficiency. However, existing developed requirement models and hence, resulting web-based e-procurement systems in Nigeria are fragmented, and limited to only some components of the procurement lifecycle. This study aims to develop a requirement model capturing the entire procurement lifecycle with a view to providing a basis for the development of a holistic web-based e-procurement system for public procuring entities in Nigeria. A qualitative approach was adopted, where literature review was conducted to identify the existing manual public procurement process. A requirement model comprising of a \"business requirement model (BRM) with 14 actors performing 38 business use cases and a system requirement model carrying out 91 different use cases\", was developed.",

The study aimed to determine the awareness, perception, and role of demonetisation regarding the adoption of digital payment apps. The study collected the primary data through a structured questionnaire from 396 UG and PG students in the Ghaziabad district. The study found no significant difference between the expected and actual benefits of digital payment apps. Qualification and gender were found to be significant factors for the adoption of digital payment apps. Convenient, time-saving, and no need to carry cash are the main factors for adopting and using the digital payment app. Lack of trust, risk associated with it, and unavailability of the technical equipment are the reasons found by the study for not using digital payment apps. The study suggests ways for companies to build the trust of their customers to adopt digital payment apps.",

Our empirical evidence validates energy lead growth hypothesis in all five economies. Infrastructure development impacts economic growth positively in all countries excluding Malaysia in the long-run. The impact of financial development on economic growth of Singapore was relatively greater than the rest of the ASEAN-5 countries. The association of trade openness was positive with the economic growth of Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Thailand in the long-run. The maximum speed of adjustment to long-run equilibrium was recorded for Thailand.",

The article reveals the general aspects of digitisation of VAT and introduces its chronology in the region. The experience of digitising the administration of VAT in the countries of the European Union is considered and the coefficient of VAT efficiency for a number of countries is calculated. A comparative analysis of the results of VAT digitalisation in Russia and the Sverdlovsk region is also presented. In order to compare the results of digitalisation, the indicators of VAT efficiency (C-efficiency) and its collection are estimated. Further, the article highlights the problems of VAT digitalisation. In conclusion, the authors consider the reasons for the success of VAT digitalisation in Russia and the Sverdlovsk region, and also present prospects for the digital VAT development, in particular, the transition to intellectual tax.",

  "abstract": "Deep learning models for semantic image segmentation are limited in their hierarchical architectures to extract features, which results in losing contextual and spatial information. In this paper, a new attention-based network, MSANet, which applies an encoder-decoder structure, is proposed for image data segmentation to aggregate contextual features from different levels and reconstruct spatial characteristics efficiently. To model long-range spatial dependencies among features, the multi-level spatial attention module (MSAM) is presented to process multi-level features in the encoder network and capture global contextual information. In this way, our model learns multi-level spatial dependencies between features by the MSAM and hierarchical representations of the input image by the stacked convolutional layers, which means the model is more capable of producing accurate segmentation results. The proposed network is evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets. Results show that our model achieves excellent performance compared with U-net, FCNs, and DeepLabv3.",

  "abstract": "Industrial internet of things (IIoT) plays an essential role in efficient and sustainable production in industries. Despite Wi-Fi (Standard IEEE 802.11) being considered a key technology for IIoT, it still generates higher energy consumption in IIoT devices, mainly due to the size of packets sent and the defined maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the network infrastructure. Thus, an existing problem is the need to reduce the size of transmitted packets and MTU, where data compression is a promising approach to deal with it. In order to deal with this situation, this article proposes two lightweight data compression methods to minimise the volume of data to be sent by IIoT devices: a customised binary Huffman-tree and a Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm with a flexible dictionary. Results from real experiments suggest that the proposed methods reduce energy consumption by 8% when compared to the existing solutions for IIoT.",

This paper proposes a smart recommendation system in the smart tourism application. Then, a content-based filtering method is proposed for improving search-based attributes in clustering. In addition, fuzzy C-means clustering is used to cluster the existing data in terms of the users' requests and recommend the optimised choice. Also, bat optimisation algorithm (BOA), which is a well-known meta-heuristic algorithm, is provided to improve the accuracy of the clustering to 98%, which is better than other state-of-the-art case studies. In addition, precision and recall are evaluated for predicting decision-making aspects in smart tourist applications. The results achieved are compared with those of the similar research studies and is superiority is shown.",

  "abstract": "To face the challenge of climate changes, it is necessary to change the usage of natural energy resources like oil, natural gas and coal to the use of renewable resources like the wind and sun energy providing a tool for efficient network management with using various distributed generation and storage services is a critical issue for smart microgrids. Due to the nature of this type of power grid, reinforcement learning is an online-wide framework for solving scattering problems. Therefore, while considering economic dispatch as a reference method of distributed power grid, its management is modelled locally. Here a distributed algorithm is defined for generalised consumption balancing. The simulation shows that this algorithm has the potential to maintain the stability of the safe and efficient operation of the entire network, taking in to account the local stability. Also, the cost of energy usage is reduced in transmission and distribution system.",

  "abstract": "This study provides an insight into one of digital forensics' needs by analysing big data. Digital forensics is one of the branches of forensic science specialised in recovering data from digital devices for investigation for purposes of computer crime or other goals. The study shows that the main challenges faced by digital investigators are those relating to the storage, management, and analysis of a large amount of data of various types, including organised and semi-organised. Investigators rely on specific tools to handle big data like Hadoop, Spark Apache, and SAS. Hadoop provides a system for storing massive files on distributed files and analysing their components, while Spark Apache provides quick analysis of distributed data without storing it. SAS visual analysis of big data provides fast support for data discovery and visualisation via a memory drive. An overview of these three big data technologies is reviewed through their components and the processes by which these features are compared and then compared. The study shows how the greatest benefit is achieved by bringing these tools together when using rather than relying on one and not the other.",

In this survey paper, we compared a variety of papers and the methods that were introduced through them on achieving better results for the problem at hand. As ABSA is currently being used for customer satisfaction and product feedback most of the papers have datasets containing reviews. This survey paper discusses various solutions in-depth and gives a comparison between them. Firstly, we discuss rule-based approaches and then move to complex approaches that involve both rule-based approaches and neural networks. Also, major emphasis is shed on the principles and the workflow of the method discussed.",

To resist different kinds of attacks, S-boxes must be constructed very cautiously. There are some schemes which are known to design S-boxes, interestingly these are based on evolutionary heuristics. In this paper, we have proposed a new approach for the construction of 8 × 8 S-boxes from the existing 4 × 4 S-boxes. We have used these 4 × 4 S-boxes in the design because of their good cryptographic properties. Evaluation of the proposed S-boxes properties is done by the SET Tool fa toolbox for S-box analysisg (Picek et al., 2014) and compared them with the S-boxes of mCrypton, Twofish, Kalynapi1, MD and Safer ciphers. The results show that the S-box generated by our approach has good cryptographic properties and these S-boxes can be used as one primitive for data encryption.",

  "abstract": "The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has widely spread round the globe. Due to the large number of infected cases and rapid spread, it has been declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization on March 2020. There are several methods that identify and detect the COVID patient. However, detection using these methods can be confirmed after up to 10 days of the infection. This research presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification model for detecting a COVID patient using CT image of patient. The dataset, used for the study, consists of CT images of variable sizes. It is a challenge for building a CNN model for variable sizes of the input image. This research uses a hybrid technique to overcome this challenge. It employs and analyses three different methods (such as Adam optimiser, Stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimiser, and RMSProp optimiser) for building the CNN model. Among the three CNN models, for CT image-based classification for infected or non-infected patient, adam performs better than RMSprop and sgdm. The classification accuracy achieved using adam is 94.9%, while RMSprop achieved an accuracy of 91.8% and sgdm reached 93.1%.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic ontology enrichment. The content of the considered ontology in this work is a set of computer science skills, used to score and rank profiles according to their curriculum vitae (CV). Starting from an initial ontology, defined manually by experts, named entities are extracted from CVs, then, by using the TF-IDF method we determine which words are more likely representative of skills of a given area of expertise. Obtained words are then inserted in the corresponding area of expertise branch of the ontology. The enrichment is controlled by a heuristic based on an entropy-like quantity that measures the profiles ranking disorder, caused by the new word insertion, assuming that such disorder is correlated with the amount of noise in the ontology. The obtained experimental results confirmed that the entropy-like quantity can be used to control the automatic enrichment of the ontology.",

  "abstract": "Time synchronisation in any distributed network can be achieved by using application layer protocols for time correction. Time synchronisation method proposed in this article uses symbol timing recovery at the physical layer to correct the application layer clock. This cross layer methodology diminishes the quantity of message trades needed by the application layer for time synchronisation thus resulting in energy saving. Precision of skew estimate can be increased by using multiple message exchanges. Examination of the cross layer strategy including the simulation results, the experimentation outcomes and mathematical analysis demonstrates that clock skew at physical layer is the same as of application layer, which is actually the skew of hardware clock within the node.",

However, views and strategies differ on how hospitals can facilitate or enable this exchange process. This study explores a relationship between two constructs, i.e., a flexible collaboration infrastructure – an integrated set of IT assets and networking functionalities that support applications and enable business collaboration – and health information exchange. Second, we argue that the strength of this relationship is influenced by the degree to which hospitals deploy security measures. Findings – based on an SEM-PLS analysis on a sample of 983 European hospitals – show a positive relationship between the two constructs. We additionally find that hospitals' security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data condition this particular relationship. Our findings contribute to the literature and provide valuable insights for hospitals.",

The preservative technology lessens the rate of deterioration, and often results in the enhanced shelf life of perishable items. The foremost motive of this study is to find an optimal price, optimal cycle length, and optimal investment policy to improve retailers' profit through preservative technology. We present a comprehensive and comparative analysis of EOQ models considering preservation and without preservation. The Weibull deterioration is included in a ramp type demand function of price and time. The concavity of the profit function shows a maximum profit. The numerical examples support our results. Further, the most sensitive demand parameters and decision variables are found via sensitivity analysis. The proposed study provides enough impetus for managerial decisions, e.g., when and how much to invest through the proposed model.",

The aim of the article is to present a theoretical reflection on this topic and case studies to eliminate the cognitive gap observed in this area. The authors present the current knowledge on the challenges faced by business process management in the era of hyperautomation, especially from the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). They discuss theoretical aspects and, in the form of two case studies, present how hyperautomation reduces traditional business processes to tasks performed mainly automatically and increases the importance of dynamic business processes (BPs), which are difficult to copy as a source of competitive advantages. This is especially important in the case of SMEs, which usually do not use their size (effect of scale) as a competitive advantage, but rather, their knowledge, speed of adaptation, or flexibility of action.",

The concepts of sustainability, already present in aviation, and digitalisation, have become even more important in the industry. As digitisation and sustainability are two processes that need to be done together and are interdependent, and the results of which will have an impact on all stakeholders, whether positive or negative, they need to be completed successfully. Smart airports are airports where networked technologies such as IoT devices are widely used to support operations and operational planning and management. In this way, airports can become paperless and reduce environmental waste and pollutants. In this study, the concepts of sustainability and digitalisation are first discussed separately and then together, as well as the difficulties that digitalisation will bring and the contribution of digitalisation to aviation sustainability.",

We identify the main observations (what we know) and challenges (what we do not know) on SQL injection attacks. We perform this tertiary review using six scientific databases. Based on a rigorous search process, we consider in our study 11 secondary studies published in the last decade. We define six research questions that help us determine the current state of the art in SQL injection attacks. We organise the main observations and challenges into definitions, most common research topics related to SQL injection attacks, detection and prevention techniques, and limitations of the studies. Finally, we identify open issues that could guide future research work.",

Digital cultural heritage served as a first aid kit amidst COVID-19 reshaping the deliverable experience. Nevertheless, the pandemic created new research streams; no study so far has reviewed digital resilience within museums and festivals. Drawing on a review of 75 papers, and multiple case study analyses, this paper presents three major streams revealing opportunities and problems attendant to social media and digital transformation as the modus operandi during the lockdown, and global best practices of museum and festival reactions including Thessaloniki International Film Festival and MOMus. This study views COVID-19 as a disruptive event inaugurating a brand-new digital experience era. The study serves as a valuable classification and theoretical starting point for researchers and, second, as a roadmap on challenges and future research agenda directions of digital museum/festival experience amid digital transformation in the post-pandemic era.",

  "abstract": "Innovation through new technologies are key elements of change in the financial sector and this has led to major efficiency gains, even though these changes can be accompanied by uncertainty. Life insurance is not an exception to this. With developments in technology and new ways of service provision, these technologies are enabling the creation of new insurance products, services, and business models. Innovation through technology provides opportunities for traditional insurers to transform themselves and it also forces them to compete with well-founded companies that are beginning to reinvent themselves by providing new services and lowering the costs. Based on a social representation, this study presents consumers attitudes towards innovation in life insurance. Results suggest that there is low interest for respondents to engage with new sources of innovation and experimentation. Consequently, this should trigger insurance companies in the Republic of Macedonia to improve their performance in terms of incorporating new sources of innovation by focusing on the positive experience of the developed countries where innovation in life insurance is generally accepted and represents part of the system security of the population.",

  "abstract": "This paper analyses the implications of the platform economy on the tourism industry, focusing on the ground transportation sector. The shifts from ownership to access and from products to services have induced dramatic changes triggered by the emergence of innovative digital marketplaces. The tourism industry, considered as a sectoral system of production, has been largely disrupted by the emergence of platforms running two-sided markets. The paper highlights and clarifies the diversity through the analysis of the different economic models at work. The paper provides an analytical framework for characterising the market mechanisms and understanding the dynamics of ground transportation in the tourism industry. Finally, the paper illustrates the evolutions from innovations triggered by start-ups usually running a service to the recent platform strategies implemented by large firms or municipalities, aiming to develop transportation solutions addressing the varieties of tourists' preferences, towards perfect mobility or mobility as a service.",

  "abstract": "Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for cloud-based remote clinical services, both for diagnosis and monitoring. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically amplified this need. E-government programs should quickly go towards the expansion of this type of services, also to avoid that people (especially elderly) renounce treatment or adequate healthcare. However, to be effective, latency between IoT medical devices and the cloud should be reduced as much as possible. For this reason, fog computing appears the best approach, as part of the elaboration is moved closer to the user. However, some privacy threats arise. Indeed, these services can be delivered only based on secure digital identity and authentication systems, but the intermediate fog layer should learn nothing about the identity of users and the link among different service requests. In this paper, we propose a concrete solution to the above issue by leveraging eIDAS-compliant digital identity and by including a cryptographic protocol to provide anonymity and unlinkability of user's access to fog servers.",

It describes the nature and characteristics of big data, distinguishes between traditional, continuous auditing and continuous monitoring, importance of data analytics for internal auditors, applications of big data and audit data analytics. It further discusses benefits of big data analytics (BDA), concerns and challenges which are likely to affect the auditors deeply but do not yet have perfect solutions. As there has been a big hype about BDA and auditors claim that BDA is the future, auditors need to reshape their talent, professional qualifications, skills, and competencies in order to meet the emerging technological challenges. At the end, the paper suggests the need for updating the accounting curriculum at the university and professional accounting bodies levels and also gives direction for future research.",

  "abstract": "To present a secure and authorised communication among customers, smart meters, utilities and smart grid (SG) communication should adopt a cryptographic mechanism to ensure involved entities' authentication, message integrity and confidentiality. To address efficient ways of authentication and secure session establishment, we construct an anonymous session key agreement protocol for the smart grid environment. This construction also uses fog as a specialised middle layer technique to make communication efficient. The formal proof of security is demonstrated under the widely adopted random oracle model (ROM) along with performance evaluation. Moreover, simulation for security validation is performed under broadly-accepted 'automated validation of internet security protocols and applications', which indicates that the protocol is safe. Comparison with recent proposals demonstrates an advantage in efficiency. In a nutshell, the proposed protocol achieves desirable security goals and performance attributes.",

This article provides a framework strategy to help managers apply SSCM to their organisations and partners. The methodology employed in this study is based on the literature search, best practices, and needs of regional large, medium and small manufacturing companies regarding SSCM. Companies located in and around the city of Terre Haute, Indiana, USA, were visited to observe their sustainable initiatives. Employees responsible for supply chain management were interviewed. The companies included large-size companies, medium-size companies, and small-size companies. As a result of this research, a framework has been developed for SSCM implementation. This research's practical implication is that this framework can be used in any manufacturing company regardless of their size with some adjustment due to regional consideration.",

The resultant advantages for banks and customers are faster and more convenient banking services. Through digitisation, SBI has transformed its physical operations into virtual operations. In the competitive environment that drives the technology generation today, banks are making use of technology to make it attractive to their customers. Banks in the new age have more privileges with all digital infrastructures and services than traditional banks that were active at the time. Bank of Calcutta was the first bank to be established in India in 1806 and later turned into the SBI. As the Indian subcontinent's oldest commercial bank, SBI boosts the country's trillion-dollar economy and meets the aspirations of its large population. This study focuses on SBI's path from the traditional banking process to the modern digital banking process. This study may help to understand SBI's detailed digital journey from the beginning. The survey data analysis also underlines the advantages and disadvantages of virtual banking.",

  "abstract": "The performance of differential evolution (DE) algorithm largely depends on its crossover operator, whose substantive characteristics are to make the algorithm search in a subspace of the original search space. Different crossover operators use different subspace divisions, and how to choose a suitable crossover operator for a specific optimisation problem is still an open issue. This paper proposes variable-grouping-based exponential crossover (VGExp), where all variables are divided into multiple groups based on interaction information, and the variables that are mutated simultaneously have a high probability of coming from the same group. Moreover, the solutions can improve the accuracy of the variable grouping and provide initial guidance for optimisation. Therefore, the proposed VGExp seamlessly combines variables grouping technique and differential evolution.

  "abstract": "Collaborative production among manufacturing enterprises is the focus of research in the field of collaborative manufacturing. In order to solve the problem of weak collaborative operation ability of manufacturing enterprises, based on the understanding of collective intelligence, this paper first analyses the evolution and development of collaborative manufacturing, gives the challenges and opportunities faced by collaborative manufacturing, and proposes a collaborative manufacturing operation model of manufacturing enterprise based on collective intelligence (CICoModel). Then based on CICoModel, the existing collaborative manufacturing domain knowledge is summarised, and a collaborative manufacturing process modelling language CoM-PML is proposed for collaborative manufacturing production planning. Finally, for practical application, a modelling and simulation system POMES4CM based on CoM-PML is developed, and three real collaborative manufacturing process data are selected for case verification. The validation results show that POMES4CM can obtain a guiding process model (PM) and production plan, which can improve the production efficiency of manufacturing enterprises.",

  "abstract": "Cloud computing as a new technology can provide significant advantages in electronic banking services. Adoption of this technology in e-banking services requires consideration of several factors. The main objective of this study is to identify and rank the effective factors on adoption of cloud computing in e-banking. The factors were identified from literature review in four dimension based on TOE and HOT-fit models (technological, human, environmental and organisational factors). As a result of this study, 16 factors were identified in four dimensions. Using fuzzy group decision-making model and pairwise comparison between factors (by a survey of 63 experts, academics and practical persons in the field), those factors were weighted and ranked. The results show that technical, environmental, human and organisational factors respectively should be considered for adoption of cloud computing in e-banking and especially 'privacy and security', 'political problems', 'complexity' and 'compatibility' are main factors in adoption of cloud computing in Iranian e-banking services.",

  "abstract": "Several decades ago, attention was directed to biometrics as an alternative to passwords that can be discovered or 'shoulder surfing' by others. Various authentication methods have been provided that rely on the user's biometrics, such as a fingerprint of a face, iris, voice, and others. Unfortunately, ways were found to imitate these visible fingerprints for using them in penetrations. Therefore, many researchers were interested in studying the possibility of using brainwaves for authentication purposes, as relying on hidden vital features increases the difficulty of breaking and imitation. This paper presents an analytical study of the proposed brainwave-based biometric authentication systems. It provides a comparison of signal acquisition methods for the brainwave-based authentication system. Also, the paper classifies brainwaves using its relevant features. It also presents the phases of the brainwave-based authentication system. Finally, it provides a detailed discussion of several factors that affect the accuracy of the brainwave-based authentication system results, and evaluate the compatibility level of the brainwave with the biometric requirements.",

  "abstract": "Coronavirus has infected many countries across the globe and is still spreading. As health sectors are experiencing an unexpected rise in cases each day, researchers are perpetually trying to discover a permanent antidote for the virus. Considering the spread, it becomes imperative to predict the spread of disease to mitigate the spread. This paper proposes a stacked ensemble model to predict occurrences of COVID-19 using Exponential Smoothing (ETS), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Neural Network Auto-regression (NNAR) as the base models. Each base model is trained individually on the disease data set, whose regress values are then used to train the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The stacked ensemble model outperforms the base models in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results conclude that the ensemble model is competent to forecast future COVID incidences in comparison to other statistical time series models.",

  "abstract": "Integration processes are considered workflow processes that can be modelled using a process modelling language. Integration platforms usually offer a modelling language based on the well-known integration patterns. To automatically verify the logical correctness of such processes, they must be formally specified. Although there is a proposal in the literature that translates the integration patterns documented by Hohpe and Woolf into coloured Petri nets, it targets conceptual pattern definitions and does not cover all integration patterns found in actual implementation of integration platforms. More complex conceptual patterns usually have to be adapted when realised by a specific integration platform. We show how an actual modelling language that implements integration patterns can be translated into coloured Petri nets and its formal properties be verified. We intend to inspire researchers interested in the verification of models designed with other platform dependent message-based languages that also realise the same integration patterns.",

The embedded system used for environment monitoring is implemented using an ARM Cortex-M4 core-based STM32L4 series development board integrated with multiple sensors. The sensed data (i.e., temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure) can be wirelessly sent to the Mbed cloud managed by the Pelion device management platform. The data values can also be sent to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with user authentication. We develop three application appliances that can be controlled remotely over Internet through the Pelion platform. The proposed IoT system has been successfully implemented on the STM32L4 series development board with the main application program developed using C++ and the GUI developed by C# programming. The work of hardware and software co-design can be a practical paradigm of engineering education for IoT hobbyists and college students.",

  "abstract": "Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is the heart of almost every critical infrastructure system, whereby SCADA is generally employed in order to control and to monitor both the physical and industrial processes within these systems. It is, thus, of vital importance that any vulnerabilities of SCADA system to be identified and mitigated to prevent unplanned incidents, malicious activities, and cyber-attacks. The IEC 60870-5-104 refers to an international standard applied for tele-control in electrical engineering and power SCADA systems, which appears to be a significant principal protocol in electrical power system automation. Major industrial control vendors employ this protocol to monitor and to manage power utility devices. Nonetheless, IEC 60870-5-104 suffers from several designs and implementation weaknesses in terms of security aspects. As such, this study briefly presents this protocol and summarises its security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it highlights the potential cyber-attacks based on the identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, the paper depicts several possible countermeasures to tighten the security of the SCADA systems.",

  "abstract": "The notion of access control allows data owners to outsource their data to cloud server, while encouraging the sharing of data with legally authorised users. Note that the traditional access control techniques only allow authorised users to access the sharing data. However, it is intractable to obtain the required data when the data owner encounters some emergency circumstances, such as, medical first-aid. Recently, Yang et al. proposed a self-adaptive access control scheme, which can ensure secure data sharing in both normal and emergency medical scenarios. However, their construction needs to involve an emergency contact person. We argue that Yang et al.'s scheme suffers from two weaknesses: 1) it is vulnerable to single point of failure when the emergency contact person is offline; 2) the two cloud model brings extra computation and communication overhead. To overcome the above shortcomings, we present a new efficient self-adaptive medical data access control by integrating fuzzy identity-based encryption and convergent encryption. Specifically, our proposed construction can achieve patients' data access by their fingerprint in emergency setting. Furthermore, the proposed scheme supports cross-user data deduplication and improves the performance of system by convergent encryption. Experiment results show that our scheme has an advantage in efficiency.",

  "abstract": "Camouflage is the most common approach employed by armed forces to conceal something from the enemy's gaze on the battlefield or elsewhere. This article covers the literature on several strategies used to find concealed objects that have features in common with the surrounding environment in terms of colour, texture, orientation, and intensity levels. The concern of this research is the use of saliency map to locate the camouflaged object in the scene. The proposed methodology generates a saliency map based on region contrast. Another application for detecting the hidden object in the scene is to evaluate the ability of the blending camouflage pattern. Therefore, computations have been performed to locate the hidden object within the surrounding environment and to find the effectiveness of a camouflaged texture. A comparative study has been conducted here that compares the performance of saliency map based on centre surrounded, global contrast and proposed region contrast. The focus area for this comparison is on camouflaged object only. Based on precision, recall and F-measure values, the performance of mentioned approaches have been evaluated.",

India, the second largest consumer base worldwide, is at present the fifth greatest destination for the online retail globally and stands merit for providing new growth avenues to future retailers as well as the existing retailers facing saturation levels in the west. This study examines the antecedents and the behavioural consequences of e-loyalty in Indian context to draw meaningful insights for the apparel retailers, especially when home stay restrictions of COVID-19 have forced brick-and-mortar retailers to shift to only e-retail mode. The findings received from a survey of 1,200 female e-shoppers from India suggest that e-REP, e-SAT, e-trust, e-CO and e-PV are the antecedents of e-loyalty while e-WOM advocacy and RI are its behavioural consequences. Therefore, by taking care of e-REP, e-SAT, e-trust, e-CO and e-PV of female shoppers, the e-retailers can ascertain improved bottom lines along with costless WOM advocacies.",

Moreover, most of the reasons of migration are for business motive, migration after marriage, search of better employment opportunities and to live good quality of life. These migrations create major changes in population dispersion and have its effects on the cities and states of India. The migration which happens inside the country by nature is classified as internal or inbound migration Therefore, This study is to explore various types of motives and purpose which induce people to migrate such type of activities and also propose a holistic model for Indian entrepreneurial and philanthropic diaspora.",

  "abstract": "Two years into Malaysia's digital economy transformation plan, consumers' reliance on cash remains intact despite the tremendous responses on the supply side. This study aims to identify proactive measures that can help promote and accelerate mobile payment adoption by examining the antecedents of consumers' intention to use e-wallets at three stages: static, interaction, and transaction. The regression results from 1,147 consumers reveal that differentiating e-wallet usage into three functional services yields valuable insight. The UTAUT constructs are significant when explaining transactional functions, but only performance expectancy and social influence matter for static and interaction functions. Overall, comparative economic value (CEV) is more prevalent than UTAUT in explaining consumers' intention to use e-wallets, while the role of perceived trust is inconclusive. The results suggest that policymakers should improve the regulations and legislation to enhance consumers' trust to induce more e-wallet subscriptions and expedite the country's transformation into a cashless economy.",

  "abstract": "Air pollution is an increasingly serious problem in urban areas as urban agglomerations develop. Ecological efficiency assessment is a key method of regional environmental regulation, and data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are widely utilised to compute ecological efficiency scores in the presence of stochastic factors. This paper focuses on two kinds of relationships among cities within urban agglomerations and constructs DEA models by inserting the different relationship matrices. The new models are utilised to assess the ecological efficiency of China's three major urban agglomerations, namely \"Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei\", \"Yangtze River Delta\", and \"Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\", using a system with pollution emission indexes. The results of our empirical study illustrate the performance of urban agglomerations from 2014 to 2019 and provide details about efficiency scores for their member cities.",

  "abstract": "Russia has one of the highest levels of electricity consumption both per unit of GDP and per capita globally. This study quantifies the degree to which electricity consumption is influenced by population, personal income, industrial production, and other factors, utilising multiple regression of historical data from across the federal subjects of the Russian Federation from 2011 to 2016. We model regional-level electricity consumption to estimate the total electricity demand in each region. Implementation of smart grids must play an influential role in boosting energy efficiency and reduction of energy waste both for households and manufacturing processes. The motivation of our study is to try to answer three research questions, related to each other. First, what is the basic model to predict electricity consumption in Russian regions? Second, how to value smart grid penetration in Russian regions? The third, is there any statistically significant impact of smart grid implementation on electricity consumption? We utilise a sectoral approach, to assess the effect on a regional level and at a sectoral level as well.",

  "abstract": "Semantic image segmentation makes a pixel-level classification play an essential role in scene understanding. Recently, most approaches exploit deep learning neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to tackle the image segmentation challenge. Common issues of these CNN-based methods are the loss of spatial features during learning representations and the limited capacity for capturing contextual information in a large receptive field. This paper proposes a diffusion convolutional network (DCNet) to combine the CNN and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) for semantic image segmentation. In the proposed model, diffusion convolution is formulated as a graph convolutional layer to aggregate structural and contextual information without losing spatial features. The final segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets show better performance than baseline approaches and can be competitive with state-of-the-art methods.",

  "abstract": "With the rapid development of EEG technology, the rapid selection of EEG data features makes it possible for subsequent applications. To improve the relevance of EEG data, this paper proposes a feature selection algorithm of EEG data based on GPU technology. This method takes the whole gene pathway as a whole, takes its EEG data path as a specific variable, and quantifies each path by distance measurement; secondly, it uses regularisation dimension reduction technology to brush out the essential features of EEG data and makes use of this method to select the essential features of EEG data. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to evaluate the path model quickly and accurately. The experimental analysis shows that the method solves the problems of high requirement of EEG data sample distribution and slow evaluation speed. Moreover, the method proposed in this paper shows the great ability of real-time performance.",

Hence the majority of the research in this area is devoted to designing optimal scheduler based on a plethora of techniques such as heuristic, greedy, genetic, game theory, bio-inspired, machine learning etc. for fully dependent or independent task graphs. Motivated by these works, we propose an efficient greedy task scheduling algorithm for precedence constrained task graphs with varied dependencies (no, partial and fully) on computational grids. Performance of the proposed task scheduling algorithm is compared with respect to Turn Around Time (TAT) and grid utilisation against Hungarian, Partial Precedence Constrained (P_PCS) and AND scheduling algorithms. Simulation results shows that the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm is on a par with Hungarian, P_PCS and AND scheduling algorithms and the running time of proposed algorithm is better than Hungarian and is on a par with P_PCS algorithm.",

In this research paper, we propose a novel framework for activity recognition from video sequences captured from static cameras and those captured from UAVs. The proposed framework, named HARDeep, consists of three models: an optional scene stabilisation model for UAV captured video sequences, a human detection model leveraging YOLOv3, and, to extract the set of video frames containing humans, an activity recognition model leveraging the ensemble of three deep learning models: GoogleNet, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. HARDeep is evaluated against three datasets including Hollywood2, KTH and the UCF-ARG dataset, consisting of video sequences captured from UAVs. The recognition accuracies are compared with the various inference models leveraging wide learning paradigms.",

  "abstract": "Social media is progressing rapidly, and it holds great potentials for everyday lives, including for educational purposes. These potentials can be harnessed in improving the acceptance of social media in informal learning. Informal learning has broken the barriers inherent in the old order of formal learning. However, there is a lack of research in social media acceptance relating to informal learning for academic researchers. This research aims to develop an acceptance model of social media for informal learning from an academic researcher's perspective. To achieve this aim, this research integrates two theories as to the foundation for the development of the model: technology acceptance model 3 and theory of constructivism. The proposed model was evaluated using the quantitative approach with social media users. The proposed model includes key technological, individual, and interactive factors. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the interaction of social media and informal learning.",

  "abstract": "In order to overcome the low feasibility of traditional resource recommendation methods, this paper proposes a personalised resource recommendation method based on machine learning. Firstly, the user-based collaborative filtering algorithm is used to calculate user personalised similarity, and then content-based collaborative filtering algorithm is used to calculate resource content similarity through cosine similarity. Combined with user similarity and resource content similarity, a hybrid computing model of resource similarity is established, and personalised recommendation is realised through statistical machine learning. The experimental results show that: the F-measure value of the method can reach 0.97, the coverage rate is maintained above 50%, the popularity is above 0.8, and the MAE value is always the minimum, and its precision is always higher than that of the contrast method. It shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the precision and feasibility of personalised recommendation results.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Integrated Supply Management",
  "abstract": "The scenario of isolated companies competing with each other has evolved to a holistic vision, where companies collaborate and work together to maintain supply chain competitiveness. Integrated supply chain planning, although challenging, is necessary to foster competitive advantage and to ensure companies' survival in difficult times. Concepts and technologies introduced by the Fourth Industrial Revolution support such integrated planning models. This paper presents a systematic literature review on integrated supply chain planning aiming to identify research streams, opportunities and the impact of Industry 4.0. The study identified the lack of research on supply chain planning which considers Industry 4.0 concepts and opportunities. Five prevailing research streams stand out: 1) approaches to deal with complexity; 2) the consideration of uncertainty; 3) raw material inventory control and procurement processes; 4) the necessity of considering environmental impacts; 5) particular models for dealing with limited lifetime products. Finally, the following future research opportunities were identified: 1) improving decision-making models to consider stochastic and dynamic behaviours; 2) extending the models to include larger networks with more variables; 3) developing more efficient solving approaches.",

  "abstract": "Dairy manufacturing is one of the oldest sectors that involve the production of liquid milk, ghee, curd, butter, etc. The sector has witnessed transformation with ages by serving people with many dairy-based products as needed. Dairy farmers have been resilient in handling the pandemic with the support of the government through societies. Yet, risks could be handled better by redefining the traditional production process and attracting more farmers to join societies. The present study is structured into three phases. The first phase assesses the economic impact of the pandemic on the Indian dairy sector in terms of gross production value. The second phase involves a case study conducted on a dairy manufacturing unit using a simulation approach. The final phase involves an empirical study with dairy farmers to understand various aspects of dairy farming. Recommendations based on supply chain and implications have been provided to improve the sustainability of the sector.",

The developed methodology is based on capital budgeting and combines it with several financial ratio considerations. This study found that capital budgeting and several financial ratios are proven tools that help industries make the best decisions between options. Based on econometric calculations, the divestiture option is more advisable than the refurbish scheme. First, this study is scientifically met with the aim of asset optimisation in the logistics sector, but it can be adapted for other types of businesses with adequate adjustments. These findings are practically applicable to help industries make faster decisions. This study contributes to the development of knowledge on global logistics businesses.",

  "abstract": "Advanced persistent threats (APTs) refer to sophisticated attacks to businesses and individuals in which adversaries use multiple attack vectors to achieve their objectives. The main challenge regarding APT analysis and defence is that all research body about APTs is fragmented; only a few scientific papers have discussed APT features. In order to defend against APTs, it is necessary to have a complete understanding of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In this paper, we analyse TTPs of three APT groups, namely Hellsing, Desert Falcons and Lotus Blossom, that actively targeted multimedia data storage and multimedia systems. Adopting three attack attribution models (i.e., Lockheed Martin cyber kill-chain, diamond model and course of action matrix) we provide a comprehensive cyber defence triage process (CDTP) against the considered APTs. The CDTP highlights steps undertaken by these APT groups, uncovers factors that have influenced achieving their objectives and suggests possible mitigations against them.",

  "abstract": "Digital financial services continue to expand and replace the delivery of traditional financial services to the customers. The purpose of the study is twofold. First, to consider the growing interest in price modelling for financial assets. The second goal is to trace the role of digitisation in finance on changes in the methodology of both modelling and pricing of financial assets. Digitisation automates financial products and services, as a result of which the quality of financial services is increasing, the set of offers is expanding, and the financial markets are growing numerically. The transformation of finance to 'digit' allows us to provide a real basis for the widespread introduction of Bayesian methods of modelling and valuation of financial assets. The article introduces preliminary premises for the demarcation of classical and digital finance, as well as traditional and new methods of pricing and predictive modelling in connection with the wide implementation of 'big data' and 'digit'.",

  "abstract": "Potable water quality monitoring technique has been a prominent research area for quite some time. Water borne diseases take away many lives every year throughout the world, particularly in developing and underdeveloped nations. In this work, we have therefore proposed a WSN-based energy efficient lifetime maximisation (EnLiMax) framework, for potable water quality monitoring (WQM) in metropolitan cities. The proposed framework will monitor different parameters for potable water in the main supply reservoir by deploying sensor nodes. Any aberration from the predefined thresholds for the said parameters will be reported to multiple sinks, for necessary follow ups. In this paper we have also proposed a novel network parameter for node placement, called degree of proximity (DoP). It was found that at an optimum DoP value of 3, a network will record maximum lifetime when all other network parameters are unchanged. Here through the proposed framework, we have presented methods for monitoring both surface water and underwater. The lifetime of the proposed framework is compared with some other well-known protocols in WSN. The results have shown that the proposed method and framework recorded more lifetime as compared to some very well-known protocols like LEACH, TEEN, SEP and MoDLEACH.",

Through literature review and observations pertaining to SCM developments, the paper first reveals some early patterns of SCM in manufacturing and business operations. Then, it discusses the system integration and collaboration mechanisms that make up the dominant SCM foci in current research and applications. Finally, recent technological advances that are likely to impact SCM along with pressures for environmental sustainability are recognised as potential research directions. Contributions to sustainability along the SCM evolution are also noted. The paper is original in that it not only reviews the evolution of SCM but also includes a sustainability focus. The resultant discussion is likely to benefit SCM theorists and practitioners to meet future challenges.",

  "abstract": "To reduce the greenhouse gas emissions problems of traditional fuel vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded as a promising transportation solution by industry peoples. Although EVs' performances are limited due to their limited battery power, large travelling distance during their journeys, charging delay for service, and resource price. To improve the EV's performance, this paper presents a charging time and resource cost-aware collaborative EV charging policy that selects not only a suitable charging station but also assigns timeslot for charging-discharging operation. In this paper, a decentralised EV charging/discharging network architecture is proposed in which the EV does not only communicate with the local cloud server by using the traditional vehicular network but also utilises the EV-to-charging station and EV-to-EV interaction. The simulation results indicate that the proposed charging scheduling policy results in a better charging requirement satisfaction ratio, charging delay, and resource costs than the compared traditional schemes.",

  "abstract": "Sourcing represents one of the most upstream supply chain activities, which often dictates the rest of downstream supply chain activities. As such, a poor sourcing decision has a significant trickle-down effect on the effectiveness of a buying firm's manufacturing and logistics decisions. Considering such significance, it is imperative for the firm to make a wise, systematic decision in evaluating and selecting suppliers. To support a critical sourcing decision, we propose a supplier evaluation decision-aid tool within the framework of business analytics, which takes in to account the multiple facets of supplier performance evaluation criteria. As a core of such a tool, we develop a relatively new model that is capable of considering both objective and subjective performance criteria simultaneously using a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). To verify the practicality and validity of the proposed analytics-based tool, we applied it to an actual problem facing a US aerospace company.",

  "abstract": "The tremendous amount of economic losses, welfare losses and distress among the farmers due to produce spoilage and quality losses are a few major concerns in the Indian post-harvest supply chain (PHSC). A study for identifying and analysing the impediments in the post-harvest supply chain was performed to minimise them. The interpretive structural modelling (ISM) was applied on the identified impediments to analyse the interactions among them and matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) analysis was used to categorise the impediments into four clusters on the basis of driving and dependence power. The key impediments obtained from the analyses are lack of government support, lack of transportation infrastructure and lack of fixation of minimum support price. And their revisions are to be improved with time to improve farmer profitability, rural employability and waste reduction. These impediments appear at the bottom in structural analysis thus hold a prime value among the identified impediments. The utility of this study is stated in the practical implications section, i.e., adaption of value addition practices for onion to reduce the spoilage ratio.",

We investigated the experience of the elderly using a fitness tracker through a post-adoption study by discussing technical, health, and consumer attributes. Twenty-one participants were recruited to wear a Fitbit (Alta HR) device for three months. After this period, we conducted a semi-structured interview to explore the elderly's experiences and perceptions with the device. We have used content analysis to evaluate written-interview transcripts. Our findings revealed that older adults perceived these wearable devices in six dimensions: 1) the adaptability in the user interface that caused hinder in daily activities; 2) aesthetic appeal (design, size, weight); 3) effort expectancy; 4) sense of security; 5) accuracy of received data; 6) functionality (battery shortage, lack of usefulness, screen light, waterproof, mobile measurement).",

A survey deduced from the model was sent to the destinations followed by focus groups to identify the particularities and key strategic issues related to their transformation into smart destinations. The study confirmed the relevancy of the model while underlining the necessity to further quantify some of its indicators. The destinations demonstrated great awareness of the opportunities new technologies present for tourism development. However, they all shared the same limitations in terms of resources and ability to foster a culture of innovation among all their stakeholders. The necessity for peripheral destinations to embrace digitalisation to remain competitive but also to be accompanied during this process was underlined.",

  "abstract": "China's cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) is developing rapidly in the last several years and is widely considered as a developing trend of the nation's foreign trade. The prediction of CBEC export volume can effectively reduce the risks, such as goods backlog and long cross-border logistics time, for related enterprises in many ways. However, due to the complex composition of many affecting factors, the prediction accuracy of the most existing methods is usually limited. In the paper, we propose a joint prediction approach that combines the back propagation (BP) neural network model and the support vector machine (SVM) method. A case study with publicly available data in Hangzhou, China, indicates a relative error of less than 1% with the proposed joint predication approach, which is less than the relative error obtained from either BP neural network predication or SVM predication used alone.",

  "abstract": "The essential target of this study is to examine the effect of both servant leadership and talent management on organisational ambidexterity in pharmaceutical industries in Egypt. To test these impacts, a highly structured questionnaire has been developed and circulated among 294 chemists and pharmacists in six organisations following the public area. The questionnaire was completed by 262 people, with an 89% response rate. In view of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Amos, the outcomes showed that servant leadership has a significant positive effect on both talent management and organisational ambidexterity. Furthermore, the results showed that talent management has a significant positive effect on ambidexterity, and affirmed also the mediating vital role of talent management in the relationship. Important implications have been founded and discussed for both researchers and practitioners.",

  "abstract": "The present study tries to expand the current body of literature on supply chain integration, by studying the antecedents of logistics integration and firm performance in the context of the downstream petroleum supply chain in India. Data was collected from 348 petrol stations in the states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, India. Path analysis using structural equation modelling was performed to know the strength of the relationship between the identified variables. The findings show that long-term relationship affects firm performance. Also, information technology positively affects logistics integration, which positively affects firm performance. Based on these findings, the study proposes solutions to the issues being faced in the downstream petroleum supply chain in India. The current research applies past findings on supply chain integration in the context of downstream petroleum supply chains in India and addresses the lack of academic research as well as provides specific courses of actions as implications for the issues of downstream petroleum supply chains in India.",

  "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the conservative business ecosystem and to identify opportunities for new companies to create value. Authors used a design-oriented case study with a start-up concentrating on the commercialisation of the university research. The authors consider a novel business model used by the start-up company. By analysing the model, methods are proposed for accelerating the company and the business ecosystem. The results indicate that cooperation between the product suppliers and opinion leaders plays a key role in supporting the biomedical business ecosystem. The probability of success for a new product depends on the interest of the professional community. The results add to the existing knowledge on business models for start-up companies to succeed without business expertise and extensive business network. The transformation of customers to partners stimulates the emergence of a new business model that takes into account the new role of a 'customer-partner'.",

  "abstract": "The location privacy is critical and preserving it is essential. The tracking exposes the real time location, history of visited places and parsed trajectories. Metaphorically speaking, it is the cyber equivalent of the physical stalking and as dangerous as it is. In vehicular networks in particular, this issue is serious because the autonomous vehicles periodically and timely transmit their locations, headings, speed and identity to neighbour vehicles and/or service infrastructures. To preserve the location privacy, various pseudonym-based approaches exist, mainly focusing on unlinkable pseudonym change strategies. In this paper, we propose a camouflage-based solution that prevents the linkability of pseudonyms upon their update even within low density roads where the tracking chances are high. The solution is simulated using NS2 against a global passive attacker that executes the semantic and syntactic linking attacks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in protecting the privacy.",

This study aims to measure the relationship between social commerce constructs, social support (SS) and perceived trust. The sample of the study was constituted of 289 social networking website users selected from northern India. The information regarding social commerce constructs, trust and intention to buy was collected by applying three standardised scales. Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the data. The results showed that social commerce constructs had a significant impact on social support, while social support exercised a significant effect on trust. The results also confirmed the partial mediation effect of social support. The tested research model can be utilised in the advancement of brand, new products, co-invention of value for branding, and pre-testing any idea of product development on social networking websites.",

  "abstract": "This paper aims at assessing the current e-government maturity models to identify their strengths and limitations. In doing so, a systematic literature review has been used to examine the existing e-government maturity models during the period 2000-2021. Our analysis indicates that despite the fact that e-government-maturity models provide potentially useful tools for e-government evaluation, there are significant differences across the existing e-government-maturity models in terms of the number of stages, what users can do at progressive stages, and particular perspectives underscored at specific stages. However, the shift from 'stage-based maturity models' to 'dimensional-based maturity models' is clearly observed. The new wave of e-government maturity models (2012 onward) sees e-government as a path for pursuing digital, resilience, equal, and inclusive societies rather than only as a mechanism to deliver e-services. Additionally, the existing e-government maturity models reached their possibilities to demonstrate the advanced maturity levels of e-government such as smart government.",

  "abstract": "Formalisation of the network slice as a resource allocation unit is considered a promising aspect that enables scalable and flexible resource allocation among many tenants in 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communication networks. However, the user traffic has to be passed through the central administration for processing, which leads to latency problems. To solve this problem, recent research works have suggested fixed central-to-edge resource allocation ratios as per the service type. However, this approach leads to over-provisioning of some resources. This paper provides a flexible resource allocation approach for 5G slice networks operating in a heterogeneous environment with multiple tenants and tiers. A radial basis-neural network is used to convert abstract specifications of simulation activities into precise resource needs, and then a genetic algorithm-based flexible multi-resource allocation scheme is proposed, where a versatile optimisation framework is used. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms such existing schemes.",

Proper O&M implementation has however experienced some obstacles and an initial step in resolving them is to identify them. This paper aims to identify and prioritise the O&M implementation obstacles in infrastructure projects in Iran. A comprehensive list of obstacles is prepared through a deep literature review and then used of a questionnaire survey. The gathered data from the questionnaires were analysed using the robust exploratory factor analysis method. Twenty-three obstacles are categorised under six themes of management, structure, culture, education and learning, communication, and finance. Results show that management obstacles should be considered in priority for such infrastructure projects, and by solving them.",

Our observation shows that the teaching team puts students experience as their key agenda during the weekly sprint retro and planning meetings. Our research findings also confirm that having an EduScrum Master to manage the teaching team enhanced collaboration, communication, and value delivery to students.

  "abstract": "Larger companies cannot escape from facing financial distress, which eventually leads to insolvency and unsustainability. In this regard, this study examined the relationship between ownership concentration and firm sustainability of top 200 Malaysian public listed companies for the period between the years 2009 and 2015. The two-stage least squares regression results of this study showed that ownership concentration was significantly and negatively related to firm sustainability. This finding remained the same when different proxies of ownership concentration and firm sustainability were used. Generally, this finding indicated that excessive concentrated ownership may lead to decisions that did not satisfy all key shareholders, and may reduce the level of firm sustainability.",

  "abstract": "The prime objective of the current study is to test prominent seasonal anomalies for Indonesian securities markets, which are mostly reported for advanced markets. The closing values of nine different indices of the Indonesia Stock Exchange have been considered for the analyses. The time frame of 2005 to 2017 has been utilised to estimate the results. Four major calendar anomalies, including the day of the week effect, the month of the year effect, the Halloween effect, and the trading month effect, have been tested. The study also tests the incidence of volatility clustering and whether this clustering differs across positive and negative news. This has been achieved by deploying the threshold generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (T-GARCH) model. The results of calendar anomalies tests indicate the presence of strong day-of-the-week effect. The results also lend weak support to the Halloween effect. However, the results do not support the presence of the month-of-the-year effect and the trading-month effect. The results of volatility clustering are highly significant, and it is also observed that volatility clustering varies significantly across positive and negative news.",

  "abstract": "Credit card defaults cost the economy tens of billions of dollars every year. However, financial institutions rarely collaborate to build more comprehensive models due to legal regulations and competition. Federated XGBoost is an emerging paradigm that enables several companies to build a classification model cooperatively without transferring local data to others. The conventional Federated XGBoost suffers from the inverse inference according to splitting nodes selection and the class imbalance problem severely. Utilising the characteristic of splitting points' selection, we propose an optional splitting extraction model to reduce the leakage risk of raw data statistics. Moreover, an adjusted AUPRC (the area under the precision-recall curve) is introduced into the gain function to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Our experimental results show recall and AUPRC increased by 7%-10% and 4%-8%, respectively, without sacrificing other estimations compared to the existing state-of-the-art. Furthermore, communication iterations also decreased significantly in our proposed method.",

However, security remains the main key for the success of any technology. In this paper, we aim to provide structural guidelines to secure IoT-based smart cities. We should consider the IoT-based functional requirements in parallel with the security requirements based on the security triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Moreover, we should consider the security challenges of smart cities based on the cube: Big data, Resource limitation, Interoperability, and Scalability. We then present solutions to the main threats. Finally, we assess vulnerabilities of some services offered in an IoT-based smart cities context. We show that current available services still suffer from several vulnerabilities and need associated security countermeasures for the success of the IoT-based smart cities.",

IoT collection of heterogeneous interconnected embedded devices, then cloud computing provides the possible infrastructure which could be used at any time and from anywhere. In recent times, due to the advancements in IoT and cloud computing-based devices, mainly their ability to provide remote services, they have been employed in various real-life domains. The integration of IoT with the cloud infrastructure may lead to security issues. Moreover, these IoT-based devices act as a prerequisite for linking through high-resource hubs such as cloud server (CS) for communication and resource sharing. Such a combination comprises security hazards and introduces dishonest data, the principal factors in a system fiasco. In addition, IoT policies are accommodated on public web links, which perturb the secrecy of trustworthy operators. Hence, this article planned an authentication idea on ECC for IoT-based embedded devices with CS. We discover the fuzzy structure facility for channel non-reciprocal, then ECC with one-way hash functions for secure validation. In conclusion, we scrutinise the planned procedure through the AVISPA and related the resource constraints costs with existing authentication procedures.",

  "abstract": "This work introduces a new hash function based on the sponge structure and two chaotic maps. It aims to avoid the major problems of Merkle-Damgård construction and ad hoc structures such as multi-collision and length extension attacks. The proposed hash function consists of three phases: message processing, absorbing and squeezing. In the message processing phase, the message is divided into n blocks, each block is processed by a standard chaotic map, then the absorbing phase takes the result of the message as input and generates a new output sequence using the PWLCM chaotic map, this process being repeated until all blocks of the message are processed. The final hash value is generated by the squeezing phase. The theoretical and experimental analysis shows that the proposed hash function has good statistical properties, high resistance to collision attacks, high sensitivity to any small change in the control parameter and message, and can be easily implemented and used for digital signatures, data management and password hashing in cloud computing.",

  "abstract": "Intrusion detection requires accurate and timely detection of any bad connection that intends to exploit network vulnerabilities. Previous approaches have focused on deriving statistical features based on domain knowledge, followed by primitive machine learning and ensemble techniques. Grouping all the parameters as a single input to a model may not always be effective. In this paper, we propose using multimodal networks for network intrusion detection. The input logs are segregated into multiple sub-groups trained differently. Their intermediate representations are combined to produce the final prediction. This approach handles the strengths of individual features better as compared to normalisation. The system is evaluated on the NSL-KDD dataset and is compared with standard methods across multiple performance metrics. The proposed system achieves an accuracy of 83.5, highest as compared to other approaches. Channelling inputs for richer feature extraction is fast gaining traction, and we extend the same in cybersecurity.",

  "abstract": "This article introduces a new multilabel learning method, the Bayesian network correlation-based CC (BNCC) algorithm, to decrease the uncertainty in the label order from the classifier chain (CC) algorithm. It uses a neural network constructed in TensorFlow as the classifier of all labels and calculates the corresponding error function, which is used to eliminate the influence of the feature set on all labels. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) Bayesian network is constructed by using the error function to identify the correlations between the labels. The optimal correlation label is identified via topological sorting. Finally, the sorted sequence is used as the chain order of the CC. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the unordered CC model and other multilabel learning algorithms on several benchmark datasets.",

  "abstract": "Recommending suitable services to users autonomously has become the key to solve the problem of service information overload. Existing recommendation algorithms have some limitations, and discard the side information of the node, or ignore the information of the intermediate node, or omit the feature information of the neighbouring nodes, or not model the pairwise attentive interactions between users and services. To solve the above-mentioned limitations, this paper proposes a service recommendation approach by leveraging the graph attention network (GAT) and co-attention mechanism in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). Specifically, different types of meta-paths are first constructed, and a feature expression is learned for each node in HINs. Then, the feature information of mashups/services is aggregated by the co-attention mechanism. Finally, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is applied to recommend suitable services for users. Experiments on a real-world dataset illustrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art comparison methods.",

  "abstract": "With rapid development of media, data compression plays a vital role in efficient data storage and transmission. Deep learning can help the research objective of compression by exploring its technical avenues to overcome the challenges faced by the traditional Windows archivers. The proposed work initially investigates multi-layer autoencoder models, which achieve higher compression rates than traditional Windows archivers but suffer from reconstruction loss. To address this, an attention layer is proposed in the autoencoder to reduce the difference between the encoder and decoder latent representation of an input along with the difference between the original input and reconstructed output. The proposed attention-based autoencoder is extensively evaluated on the atmospheric and oceanic data obtained from the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC). The results show that the proposed model performs better with around 89.7% improved compression rate than traditional Windows archiver and 25% reduced reconstruction loss than multi-layer autoencoder.",

  "abstract": "Enhancing brand relationships through communication have been the focus of business strategies especially when supported by technology. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of social media (SM) communications on brand relationships and the role of SM usage in explaining brand relationship differences in different cultures. The study's theoretical framework was based on the Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Data were collected from SM users through online surveys in two countries: Albania and Turkey. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used for the theoretical model. Multigroup analysis was used to compare the effects of SM communication quality between the two cultures. The overall model revealed a positive role of SM communications in strengthening consumers' relationships with brands and a moderating effect of SM usage, indicating that greater user engagement in SM leads to stronger brand relationships. The results suggest that brand relationship quality is higher in cultures with greater SM usage. Furthermore, the results showed that the direct influence of SM communication on building brand relationships is less impactful among users of a higher collectivistic culture.",

SENR explores semantic notification and opportunistic caching strategy to enhance the data retrieval efficiency for smart systems. First, SENR performs data aggregation according to the hierarchy of namespace, and stores data over in-network storage node. It also marks each route notification at the edge nodes, and allows the interest with the same name prefix to choose the same edge routing node towards to the storage node. Second, SENR adopts link-state routing protocols to collect network topology and compute the shortest path to the content source nodes, moreover, it uses distance-vector routing protocols to select multiple alternative paths to cope with node failures. Third, SENR employs partial routing update to explicit support of dynamic paths and caching capabilities. Simulation results demonstrate that SENR can significantly reduce the content retrieval delay and routing overheads.",

For this kind of problem, the existing schemes usually sacrifice the communication efficiency of users for higher security, which often causes a lot of computing overhead. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to achieve the coexistence of safety and efficiency, and adopts the ideas of Chinese commercial encryption algorithms SM2 and SM3, proposes a cloud encryption transmission scheme that supports integrity verification, and gives a security analysis under the assumption of discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curve and Diffie-Hellman problem. Finally, the actual test and comparative experiment results show that our scheme can realise the cloud data transmission encryption and cloud storage integrity verification functions at the same time without affecting the performance of the cloud server. Moreover, it can effectively resist all kinds of common attacks, reduce the storage and computing burden of cloud users, and has certain guiding significance for the research of user privacy protection in the cloud environment.",

In traditional middleboxes, network functions are usually executed on specialised hardware (e.g., firewall, DPI). Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on the other hand, are executed on commodity hardware, employing Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies (e.g., OpenFlow, P4). Although platforms for prototyping NFV environments have emerged in recent years, they still present limitations that hinder the evaluation of NFV scenarios such as fog computing and heterogeneous networks. In this work, we present NIEP: a platform for designing and testing NFV-based infrastructures and VNFs. NIEP consists of a network emulator and a platform for Click-based VNFs development. NIEP provides a complete NFV emulation environment, allowing network operators to test their solutions in a controlled scenario prior to deployment in production networks.",

  "abstract": "One of the most overwhelming and exhilarating advancements in the field of intelligent systems has been the introduction of visual question answering (VQA), a new and exciting problem that makes use of natural language processing and computer vision for measuring the ability of a system for image understanding and generating inferences beyond object recognition, segmentation and image captioning. One of the primary goals of research in visual-based artificial intelligence is to design systems that can understand and reply to questions about visual data. The first part of the study very vividly presents numerous diversified as well as diagnostic datasets testing different visual reasoning abilities, while the second part of the study details a plethora of the recently developed approaches for VQA. Finally, a qualitative comparison of the diversity present in the various approaches has been done that can serve as an important benchmark for analysing and comparing the different characteristics and applications of these algorithms and datasets that can prove to be helpful to someone new to the field of VQA and its community.",

  "abstract": "The rapid development of software, hardware, and communications technologies has helped spread sensors, actuators, and heterogeneous devices connected through the internet, collecting and distributing a large amount of information, opening a unique class of advanced services available at any time. This paper introduced a pervasive hybrid two-stage fusion model (PHTSFM) for the cybersecurity situation evaluation and focused on multi-heterogeneous sensors to determine the impact of security threats on a networked system and precisely evaluate system safety. The multisource information's characteristics in network security analysis and data fusion security algorithms have been introduced. Multiple correlations are utilised to differentiate the normal event or outlier and abnormal event within the least delay. The simulated network assessment reveals that the proposed solution is appropriate for the network environment, and the findings of the test are precise and effective.",

  "abstract": "Aiming at the shortcomings of whale optimisation algorithm, such as easy to fall into local optimisation and slow convergence speed in the later stage, an optimisation method based on three improved strategies is proposed. Firstly, Kent mapping is introduced to initialise the population and enrich the diversity of the population; Secondly, a nonlinear convergence factor strategy is proposed to improve the global search speed and local optimisation accuracy. Finally, inertia weight is added to maintain the balance between global search and local optimisation. Simulation experiments with 13 standard test functions show that the proposed algorithm has remarkable performance in global search, convergence speed and optimisation accuracy. In addition, through its application in path planning, the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper are further verified.",

  "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) has brought the properties of convenience, intelligence, and manageability into our daily lives. Nevertheless, it also gives malicious attackers lots of opportunity to compromise our private information. Hence, the security issue over IoT has become an emergent and crucial research topic. Kalra and Sood (2015) proposed an authentication scheme for IoT device and cloud server. Unfortunately, Chang et al. (2017) have pointed out the weaknesses of Kalra and Sood's scheme and provided proper improvements. However, we have found that the improved version still exist potential risks. Thus, we aim to develop a brand-new ECC-based authentication mechanism for offering a secure session between an IoT device and a cloud server. In particular, the new method is proved secure under the examination of AVISPA, which is a formal verification tool.",

  "abstract": "Security has been the fundamental apprehension during information transmission and storage. Communication network is inordinately susceptible to intrusion from unpredictable adversaries thus threatening the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data. This is where cryptography facilitates us and encodes the original message into an incomprehensible and unintelligible form. DNA cryptography is the latest propitious field in cryptography that has transpired with the advancement of DNA computing. The immense parallelism, unrivalled energy efficiency and exceptional information density of DNA molecules is being traversed for cryptographic purpose. Currently, it is in the preliminary stage and necessitates avid scrutinisation. The foremost hindrance in the field of DNA cryptography is computational complexity and lack of sophisticated laboratories. In this paper, we discuss the existing DNA cryptographic approaches and compare their achievements and limitations to provide a better perception. In the end, a modified version of the DNA cryptography combined with soft computing is also suggested.",

The digital economy is reconstructing and reshaping the relationships and inter-connections in the quality of express industry development in China. However, there remains a lack of research on the impact of the express industry development and the digital economy. In this study, we used the spatial Dubin model (SDM) to analyse the impact of the digital economy on the quality of the express industry development from 2012 to 2020 in China. The results show that there is a significant spatial correlation between the digital economy and the quality of the express industry development in China. The digital economy was found to have positive and direct effects on the quality of the express industry and its development. The indirect effects of the digital economy in different regions on the quality of the express industry are different in China. The research findings provide a useful reference for the quality of express industry development as it relates to the digital economy.",

A total of 160 learners and 100 teachers were selected using stratified random sampling to participate in this study. Quantitative methods, including structural equation modelling data analysis, were employed to examine STEM learners' and teachers' attitudes towards mobile learning, and to investigate factors that learners and teachers consider important when accepting mobile learning in STEM. The results indicated that both teachers and learners have a positive attitude towards mobile learning. Additionally, there is no significant difference between teachers' and learners' attitudes towards mobile learning. The implication is that developers of mobile learning systems should make their platforms easy to use and also have more resources available for both teachers and learners to increase the overall acceptance of mobile learning in STEM.",

The rise of the new phenomena of crypto currency in the world raises questions about the importance of bitcoin prices compared to the exchange rate and financial openness. Using panel data, we show that the exchange rate has a positive and statistically significant impact on the price of bitcoin and financial openness has exerted a negative and significant effect on bitcoin price.

This paper takes the complex network as the research object, firstly proposes a simple network centre node determination method, and based on the connection status between the non-central node and the central node in the network, divides the network nodes into three categories, that are α (non-central node, and only directly connected to one central node), β (non-central node, and directly connected to multiple central nodes) and γ (non-central node, and not directly connected to any central node). Then, the cellular automaton is used as the computing framework, and the central node, the node connected to the centre, and the node not connected to the centre are used to construct the three-dimensional cell space, and defines rules for updating the connection among α, β and γ. Defining the rules for updating the connection between γ and the central nodes and the edge update rules between α and β with central nodes which allows nodes in a network community to connect to community centres with only a certain weight. Based on the above rules, we explore the process of community structures emerging. Finally, using a number of datasets to verify the algorithm proposed in this paper, and the results show that the rules defined in this paper can be used to complete the division of the network community while a new structure emerges on the network.",

  "abstract": "The paper empirically tests the impact of abusive supervision and organisational tenure on emotional exhaustion and counterproductive work behaviour of knowledge workers as well as investigating the moderating role of psychological capital in the relationship between abusive supervision and organisational tenure and emotional exhaustion. Data were collected from a sample of knowledge workers, i.e., teachers, in Rawalpindi and Islamabad via a two-wave onsite-based survey. The final sample consisted of 243 teachers. Structural equation modelling analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Our results show that supervisors' abusive supervision is positively related to employees' counterproductive work behaviour and that supervisors' abusive supervision and employees' organisational tenure are positively related to employees' emotional exhaustion. Additionally, employees' psychological capital moderates the relationship between employees' organisational tenure and their emotional exhaustion. Ultimately, employees' emotional exhaustion partially mediates the relationship between supervisors' abusive supervision and employees' organisational tenure and their way of engaging in counterproductive work behaviour. The paper adds to the knowledge about the antecedents to employees' counterproductive work behaviour in the field of knowledge management research.",

  "abstract": "With the proliferation of advancements in high-tech devices, the availability and sustainable supply of tantalum, tin, and tungsten (3T) as raw materials may play a crucial role. There have been controversial arguments about the origin of Rwandan 3Ts. The authors believe that it is necessary to investigate their origins by concentrating on the geology, mining, and reforms that drive 3T massive production. The findings revealed that Rwanda became the world's largest tantalum producer with 51% between 2011 and 2015, and has remained in the top three worldwide producers since 2008. The exploitation of an abundance of rock-bearing 3T mineral deposits, mining sector reforms, and the successful implementation of supply chain regulations are primarily attributed to this expansion. Their consistent output is thought to be linked to the privatisation of the mining sector, which brought about modernisation and industrialisation, which contributed to the formalisation of artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and built the capacity of local miners.",

The digital technology allowed healthcare professionals in identification and isolation to the source of the infection to prevent community transmission of the virus by remotely monitoring the COVID-19 infected patients. We proposed a prediction model using Orange Canvas Program by creating a local instance dataset of eight suspected individuals' measured body parameters. Furthermore, six machine learning classifiers such as KNN, DT, SVM, random forest, neural network and naive Bayes are implemented to train the model on the dataset and in predicting the COVID-19. The results show that the proposed machine learning model successfully detects COVID-19. The evaluation results show that the highest accuracy value is obtained with neural networks and SVM, however neural networks outperform in other statistical parameters besides the accuracy rate.",

However, LPG is highly inflammable and can easily cause fire and explosion if there is a leakage. When the gas finishes at an odd time, it will be difficult to order and get a new cylinder. There are two main objectives of this IoT-based research project. The first one is to monitor the usage of the gas and place an order through a mobile application when the gas level goes below a threshold value. The second one is to detect any gas leakage and close the knob of the cylinder when the gas leakage level goes above a threshold value and activate an alarm. This system also sends an automatic alert notification to the user through the mobile application. Apart from the mobile application, a simple web interface was also created to record the values from the sensors.",

  "abstract": "To promote sustainable manufacturing it is imperative that closed-loop material flows are considered during sustainable product design. The usefulness of various sustainable product design decision support tools depends on the ability to access accurate data related to the different lifecycle stages. The importance of digitally integrating disparate data sources and the potential for using digital threads to facilitate integration has been widely discussed. However, the approach to develop such digitally integrated capabilities is lacking in extant literature. This paper presents the development of an interoperable digital thread to integrate data from different sources across the total lifecycle interfaced with a suite of decision support tools. The application of the digitally integrated capability is demonstrated using an industrial case study. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the digital thread to acquire data from different lifecycle stages and to conduct sustainability performance analyses to help identify the most sustainable product configuration designs.",

  "abstract": "IEEE802.15.4e is the latest generation of high-reliability, low-power medium access control protocols. As part of IEEE802.15.4e, time synchronised channel hopping (TSCH) provides support for multi-hop and multi-channel communications. IEEE802.15.4e only defines when a schedule is executed; it does not specify a concrete resource schedule strategy. In this study, an IEEE802.15.4e TSCH scheduling algorithm called fair reliability scheduling algorithm (FRESA) is proposed to focus on both less delay and fair reliability. Through leaf node prior and multiple nodes sharing the same resource, there is less delay to transmit messages. Balancing the assignment of different qualities of channel offset guarantees fair reliability in message transmission. We design two strategies to ensure fair reliability, one based on per Link and the other based on per Path, and then accordingly divide our algorithm into FRESA-L and FRESA-P. Simulation results demonstrate our algorithm's performance. We also observe that FRESA-P can achieve higher reliability than FRESA-L.",

  "abstract": "The worldwide adoption of new user-centric data protection legislation (as exemplified by the EU's GDPR) and the emergence of the new user-centric personal information ecosystem are going to radically change the power relationship between consumers and firms that collect and use personal information. In this new scenario, in which the consumers' control over personal information is strengthened, firms should revise the interaction strategies which they use with empowered and increasingly privacy-aware consumers in order to obtain (and maintain in time) said consumers' explicit consent to the processing of personal information. This conceptual study argues that a strategy which considers consumers as data providers, involves them as coproducers in the value-producing processes that utilise personal information, and empowers them through an iterative, dynamic and dialogic interplay, represents a positive and proactive interaction strategy that firms can implement in the emerging ecosystem.",

Through using innovative technologies, cities are striving to start a smart city initiative for a better life. However, little is known about the implementation of smart cities and less is provided about the Middle East and North Africa region. This research attempts to embrace the different aspects of smart cities and analyses the readiness of the MENA to move towards this promising project. Interviews were conducted with key decision makers in the MENA region who are involved in smart cities projects. Results highlight the opportunities and key aspects of this project and propose three phases to the implementation of a smart city: foundation, convergence, and transformation.",

The empirical analysis was conducted using Kapetanios' unit root test, various scaling (Hurst exponent) tests, a fractionally integrated generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic model, and Markov regime-switching regression for different series, including the logarithmic returns and abnormal returns, of price and volume series. Following modelling volatility and the derivation of conditional variance, Twitter posts were employed as an independent variable over each series. The results indicate that, while public information arrivals have a positive impact on the volatility of Ripple returns, they cannot divert away the variability of the volume.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Web and Grid Services",
  "abstract": "The inefficient consumption of energy is a critical challenge in internet of underwater things (IoUTs) because of difficult replenishment of energy. It is possible to overcome this difficulty by introducing sleep-awake scheduling for energy conservation. In this paper, two schemes have been proposed focusing on energy efficiency: geo-opportunistic asynchronous sleep-awake scheduling routing technique (GOASST) and coordinated sink mobility-based GOASST (CSM-GOASST). By exploiting geographic and opportunistic routing paradigms, the advantages like path diversity and improved reliable communication have been achieved. Moreover, the coordinated sink mobility in multi-sink architecture introduced in CSM-GOASST exhibits potential in reducing end-to-end network delay. In CSM-GOASST, an optimal sink position helps to find the shortest path to deliver data to the destination. In addition, linear programming-based mathematical modelling is carried out for performance parameters to find feasible solutions. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated by performing extensive simulations.",

  "abstract": "This study investigates the long-run effect of financial repression policies on liquidity risk in the Iranian banking sector during 2006 and 2018. As a method of econometrics, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach is applied. Financial repression policies, in other words, the central bank's interventionist monetary policies have been assessed based on the endogenous money view using four indicators: the real interest rate, the legal reserve ratio, the unofficial exchange rate, as well as the bank credit to GDP ratio which can show the financial depth of an economy. The empirical results revealed that a rapid financial liberalisation policy could make the banking system riskier. Although the financial repression policies in the Iranian banking system have generally reduced the liquidity risk, the bank losses have been passed on through hidden taxes to depositors and domestic money holders, which illustrates the need for structural reforms in the Iranian banking system.",

  "abstract": "The purpose lying behind this paper is twofold. In the first place, it aims at discussing the volatility dynamics of Bitcoin, gold, oil price and stock market indices in terms of goodness-of-fit to asymmetric and long-memory GARCH models. In the second place, it focuses on examining diversification benefits of Bitcoin between 19 August 2011 and 9 November 2018 using mean-variance spanning tests. It has been discovered that the most effectively fit framework turns out to be the Fractionally Integrated Exponential GARCH model (FIEGARCH), displaying the highly significant characteristic of encompassing both of the asymmetric as well as long-memory components of conditional variance. The reached findings suggest that the shock impact on Bitcoin and gold return volatilities have proven to be permanent, while its persistence on the other indices has been discovered to be transitory. Indeed, the results show that Bitcoin yields significant diversification benefits when being added to a well-diversified benchmark portfolio.",

Using multiple regression analysis, the findings indicate that factors relating to know-how including IT-based knowledge, cognition, and competency positively influence the internal auditors' readiness for digital transformation. A positive attitude and a willingness to accept change on the part of internal auditors are also essential factors affecting their readiness. Moreover, support from organisations, including professional organisations, are key factors creating a positive working environment to drive the competency of the internal auditors to adapt themselves to cope with the advancement of technology.",

We investigate longitudinal data for students of a business school in North America and find that students systematically outperform in fall semesters than spring semesters, supporting the seasonal rhythms of human cognition. Further examinations reveal that the ambient temperature plays a dominant role over photoperiod for this seasonality, consistent with the evolutionary theory that humans' cognition is compromised by an energy deficit due to increased energetic demand in the process of thermoregulation, owing to humans' incomplete acclimatisation to the coldness compared to the darkness. We also address the potential energetic competition between humans' emotional and cognitive activities that may exacerbate seasonal cognitive fluctuations. Our results provide empirical evidence and shed light on the study of human cognition along with the increasing desynchronisation between socioeconomic and natural environments.",

We wish to do this because our goal is to analyse how the economic and financial indicators can predict the risk of failure in a sample of companies. Using a sample of 132 companies which were declared bankrupt or dissolved, we depict the trajectories behaviour of the companies on their path to failure. We analyse these trajectories to show if there are empirical evidences of the different processes of bankruptcy. We also study if the warning signs of failure are different in each of these trajectories. In conclusion, we will see that there are different failure trajectories. We can use these different trajectories to identify the indicators that warn of the risks of failure of the companies in the sample. Finally, we prove that the warning signs of failure do not occur in the same way or at the same time.",

  "abstract": "To lower the IoT device task execution latency, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining popularity among researchers that offers ubiquitous computing and communication services to IoT devices. To maximise the system task execution time and energy saving in different real-time cases, collaboration among UAV and mobile-edge computing (MEC) for IoT device task execution seems to be a promising solution. The existing task execution algorithm in the integrated UAV-MEC system suffers from higher latency and energy wastage due to lack of a proper IoT service provisioning scheme. To accomplish both time and energy gain, this paper presents a reward-based service provisioning scheme for UAV-MEC assisted IoT infrastructures by taking into account different types of UAV, IoT device, cloud, and task properties. Simulation results indicate that our proposed reward-based service provisioning algorithm outperforms the traditional air and ground offloading algorithm in terms of system timespan delay and energy cost latency.",

  "abstract": "The massive spike in security threats is one of the greatest security problems facing the internet of things (IoT). Many IoT gadgets do not have any protection features, and even the ones they have are mostly primitive and can thus easily be subject to attacks. Compromising one or more infrastructure components will theoretically lead to the vulnerability of the IoT network's entire infrastructure. The software defined networking (SDN) poses many possibilities in this sense and offers the ability to address those difficulties. In this paper, the proposed solution may not resolve all the challenges; however, it overcomes a particular challenge concerning software defined networking (SDN) without any modification to the present network architecture. The proposed secure solution allows SDN to work as an integrated and programmable controller for smart cities. According to various studies, IoT and SDN's integration allows unlocking several routes that provide security and making smart cities a reality with SDN. The SDN-based IoT network is studied in this paper, and it further proposes an effective IoT-based security system with the help of SDN-IoT design.",

Design principles and key technologies are collective terms and main pillars of Industry 4.0 which are significantly changing the manufacturing landscape from distant, esoteric concept to real and tangible. The current industries have to understand the design principles and advanced technologies with sustainability aspects for transforming their business towards the competitive environment. The manufacturers need to develop skills regarding these set of the design principles and technologies to align with current transformation. Therefore, this paper explores the design principles and key technologies with the discussion about sustainability aspects of these two main pillars of Industry 4.0. Articles from renowned journals and conferences were thoroughly studied and key points extracted to design the presented work. The authors elaborated concepts, emerging trends, applications and contributions of these building blocks in changing the current manufacturing scenario with the implications of interaction of design principles and key technologies in context of Industry 4.0. Major contributions of Industry 4.0 for sustainable manufacturing also elaborated at the end of the paper.",

  "abstract": "Budget mirrors local authorities' effective and efficient resource allocation practices. In many cases, however, a tendency toward budget slack raises genuine concern among stakeholders who participate in and are affected by the budget. The budget slack potentially exerts bias in the budgeting process which is detrimental to the accountability of local authorities. On this premise, this study aims to examine the influence of budget participation and budget adequacy on the budget performance of local governments in Malaysia and how accountability could be promoted through high budget performance. A survey-based instrument was used to collect the data for this study from various local authorities in Klang Valley. A total of 110 responses were obtained representing a 73% response rate. Partial least square (PLS) structural equation modelling results showed that the effect of budgetary participation on budget performance is direct and also mediated by budget adequacy. This implies, among others, that while participation in the budgeting process can enhance budget performance, the effect is also contingent on the adequacy of resources the participants are presented with.",

  "abstract": "In the ongoing years, biometric systems end up helpless against the spillage of template information. If a biometric template is stolen, it is lost permanently and cannot be restored or reissued. Here, we use iris biometric because of its high accuracy. In this paper, we develop a new cancellable biometric scheme using the indexing-first-one (IFO) hashing coupled with a technique called partial sort. The IFO hashing uses new mechanisms called the P-order Hadamard product and modulo threshold function paired with the partial sort technique which has considerably strengthened it further. We used the very sophisticated CASIA-v3 database which provides us with a wide range of iris templates for our experiments. As compared to the previous cancellable schemes, the analysis of the results of these experiments provides us with good accuracy and strong resistance to various privacy and security attacks.",

  "abstract": "User profiles are derived from big data left on the internet through machine learning algorithms. However, threats of data privacy leakages restrict access to the data in centralised machine learning. Federated learning (FL) can avoid privacy leakage during the data collection phase. Herein, we propose an algorithm for constructing a privacy-preserving global user profile (PPGUP) through FL in a vertical data-segmentation scenario. Participants train local clusters on their data using the CLIQUE algorithm, and carefully encrypt cluster parameters using Paillier encryption to protect parameters from an untrusted aggregator. The aggregator then makes intersections over the cluster parameters without decryption, to construct a GUP. The experiment results show that precision of PPGUP reaches 80% when is set to 1.5, which is improved by 50% compared with DP-UserPro. The runtime exhibits a linear growth with the growth of the dataset size and the increase in the number of participants.",

Data from 362 Indian users were employed to test the research model by applying structural equation modelling. The results show that perceived intention, ease of use, and usefulness have significant relation in motivating borrowers to use P2P lending platforms. However, borrowers' perceptions of trust had an insignificant impact on MU the P2P lending platform. When compared to the individual technology acceptance model, the integrated model provides further explanation regarding the motivation of borrowers to use P2P lending platforms. The study contributes to the theoretical area by identifying the factors that motivate borrowers to use P2P lending platforms for their short-term financial requirements, from a unified perspective. In addition, this research provides insights about borrowers' MU P2P lending platforms in India.",

  "abstract": "Crowdfunding is the process of collecting money from a large audience to launch an entrepreneurial project. It is mostly based on the use of internet to gather financial resources and leverage the 'wisdom of crowds' to pre-validate the potential of a business idea. In particular, equity crowdfunding allows broad groups of investors to fund new companies in return for ownership of a piece of the business. It is thus an interesting option for supporting the launch of innovative companies, although its adoption is still limited by a number of complexities and an incomplete awareness of potential benefits. In such vein, this paper delineates the status of equity crowdfunding in Italy and presents the analysis of three successful equity crowdfunding campaigns, with the purpose to collect a set of lessons learned and provide useful insights for entrepreneurs and investors as well.",

  "abstract": "The Data Centre concept has evolved, mainly due to the need to reduce expenses with the required physical space to store, provide and maintain large computational infrastructures. The Software-Defined Data Centre (SDDC) is a result of this evolution. Through SDDC, any service can be hosted by virtualising more reliable and easier-to-keep hardware resources. Nowadays, many services and resources can be provided in a single rack, or even a single machine, with similar availability, considering the deployment costs of silo-based environments. One of the ways to apply the SDDC into a data centre is through hyper-convergence. Among the main contributions of this paper are the behavioural models developed for availability and capacity-oriented availability evaluation of silo-based, converged and hyper-converged cloud computing infrastructures. The obtained results may help stakeholders to select between converged and hyper-converged environments, due to their similar availability but with the particularity of having lower deployment costs.",

In order to enhance the particle's ability to escape from the local extremum point, the social cognitive part of originally learning only from the global optimal particle is changed to the part of adaptively choosing to learn from the global optimal particle and the particle in the elite subgroup in the model. Meanwhile, in order to make the algorithm more universal, a variety of learning strategies such as elite particle opposition-based learning, subspace Gaussian learning and mean centre learning with different search characteristics are adaptively selected in the evolutionary process. Combination of the two improved measures can not only increase the universality of the algorithm, but also enhance the diversity of the population, which effectively helps the algorithm escape from the local optimum and avoid the premature convergence. Simulation results on the typical test function set and test results of comparison with other classical and newly improved PSO algorithms show that the proposed algorithm performs better in optimisation and stability.",

Phishing is a significant criminal activity for financial gains. Studies about different machine learning algorithms are a perpetual journey to detect malicious data. There are lots of algorithms proposed for detecting a phishing website. The selection of the best solution for the problem is not an easy task in a phishing domain. In this study, the focus is on experimental study of ensemble learning methods, feature reduction techniques and hybrid approach. In machine learning, for improvement in performance, ensemble learning plays a crucial role. In this study, we do a comparative analysis of bagging, boosting and stacking ensemble learning models and propose a new hybrid model in the phishing domain.",

  "abstract": "Supply chain transparency is central to sustainable business operations, and consumers are more proactively seeking out socially responsible goods and services. At the same time, the diamond industry has traditionally been 'opaque'. The perception of 'blood diamonds' continues to be a challenge to the industry. The purpose of this paper is to explore the importance and perspectives of supply chain transparency of diamond retailers in the UAE and their perceptions of the importance of transparency and ethical sourcing for consumer diamond purchasing decisions. The research findings suggest that retailers currently perceive the consumers to be indifferent or unaware of the complexity of transparency in the diamond supply chain. However, some consumers did inquire about the origin. Additionally, as they are at the end of the supply chain, retailers do not have the means to guarantee that diamonds are ethically sourced.",

We compare different resilience mitigation policies via an agent-based simulation model and show that in the presence of product perishability, the alternative sourcing policy has superior performance compared to inventory buffer creation or disruption acceptance. We analyse two supply chain contours in parallel with simultaneous and independent disruption modes. Disruption mitigation profile and the effects caused by it show that supply capacity deficit is a crucial factor defining supply chain inventory dynamics. Inventory priority scheduling rules change supply chain dynamics during different disruption impact phases.",

In this study, we compare the financial costs of different last mile delivery strategies of grocery bins by autonomous delivery vehicles in a scenario in Paris. The optimal delivery routes are calculated with the real dataset in urban areas of Paris. We compared delivery costs by using: logistical costs associated with vehicles and human resources, location data with time window constraints for establishments in Paris, and delivery scenarios obtained by solving vehicle routing problems. This research considers an economic analysis of daily delivery to help fleet operators optimise their costs by using these autonomous delivery vehicles while reducing CO2 emissions and congestion in urban areas.",

  "abstract": "Academic institutions frequently offer robust accounting training options. However, small business managers often lack formal accounting training. While the potential impact of lack of accounting training on small businesses is large, relatively little research has been done on the direct impact of different types of accounting training on small business performance. This paper utilises a sample of 148 young small business professionals from the California Central Valley with their completed surveys. Three hypotheses have been developed. This study applied stepwise regression analysis to test the hypotheses outlined above, and the results of these hypothesis tests show that tax accounting training helps to foster growth, while managerial accounting training helps to foster new technology adoption. This research responds to scholarly calls to address the dearth of research on the impact of discrete types of accounting education on small business performances. Research results will not only encourage innovations in business education, but also provide resourceful information for policy makers who work on small business policies.",

  "abstract": "Modern enterprises are currently experiencing volatile and rapid information and communication technology (ICT) change. A key challenge for business leaders is to ensure their organisations are ready for that change. This is particularly challenging when it comes to emerging ICT that may disrupt the management of existing enterprise information systems or business processes. The business model has been cited as an effective tool which organisations can use to prepare for ICT related change. However, there is evidence to suggest that the business model remains largely a nebulous concept to most organisations. This is compounded by the siloed nature of existing business model research. Using a content analysis research approach, this paper provides a holistic review of contemporary academic literature to ascertain and classify the various approaches to the study of ICT enabled business models. The literature examined is classified into nine specific thematic descriptors which underpin these specific business models. A comprehensive definition is also developed for ICT business models. This paper therefore extends our understanding of the business model concept and can be used to guide and coalesce future research on illuminating how organisations can operationalise effective business models in order to leverage new digital ICT.",

The objective of a regulatory body is to ensure a fair trading environment and to verify that the price of a stock is not being manipulated. This paper proposes a hybrid stacked artificial neural network and recurrent neural network to model the static and dynamic features of stock data. Based on the manipulated stocks, affidavits provided by the Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) of India, a daily trading dataset is created by scraping the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) website. The system is capable of identifying three types of manipulation scenarios. The proposed hybrid system is compared to various supervised algorithms, and various ensemble models and the system outperforms all with an accuracy of 96.06%.",

However, little is reported about the empirical investigation of GM practices and the associated sustainable performance within Malaysian industries. This paper aims to develop a conceptual multi-dimensional GM model and explore the relationships amongst these practices in order to eliminate the existing gap in operations management contemporary literature. To accomplish this, a structured questionnaire was designed and sent to key respondents, the managers. Two general hypotheses are postulated based on the developed model. Results were performed through techniques utilised from both advanced programs namely SPSS 23 and AMOS 23. Findings show that both hypotheses are supported as these are significant and there are positive linkages between GM and both financial and green performance. This paper is considered a portfolio and guide for Malaysian manufacturers in their trend to be sustainable.",

  "abstract": "This research aims to analyse the factors that contribute to postharvest losses of the fruit and vegetable supply chain, especially in an Indian context. The work can be broadly classified into two phases. The first phase involves the development of an ISM model with the help of literature and field experts from an agricultural university. Ten factors that influence postharvest losses were identified and their relationships with other factors were defined. The second phase involves a survey conducted among the stakeholders to determine the various losses that are incurred in the postharvest stage of agriculture. The study is highly relevant to the tropical fruits and vegetables. The results of the survey were tested for reliability and were validated using exploratory factor analysis. Further, hypotheses were proposed to study the relationships between the factors. Also, the ISM model was compared to the model proposed based on the loading patterns of responses. The results of hypotheses testing revealed that out of ten developed hypotheses, nine were significant. Both models were found to be similar, except the four factors that grouped together in pairs in the proposed model. Recommendations on how to improve the real-time tracking to make timely interventions have been provided.",

  "abstract": "This article presents a synopsis and the summaries of a series of presentations delivered in two workshops that we organised in 2019 and 2020. The purpose of the two workshops is to find practical solutions to the emerged peer learning problems in a distributed learning (DL or cyberlearning) environment, which becomes popular under and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A DL environment not only consists of personal or virtual instructors, online courseware, communicational technologies, but also peer learners. Collaborative learning between peers in a distributed learning environment is inadequately addressed in research literature and paid insufficient attention in practices. In an active and constructive learning environment (Chi and Wylie, 2014) such as team projects and research experiences for undergraduates (REU), learning from peers is as helpful as learning from the instructors. However, collaborative learning from remote peers is much more challenging than face-to-face teamwork. This synopsis can serve as a road map for readers to find your interested topics starting at the broad view of the peer-learning problem in a DL environment and practical solutions as first-hand experiences of 20 speakers. The summaries of the topics, the linked videos, PowerPoint slides, and the references will guide the readers to explore such a hardly treaded territory at a flexible pace, breadth, and depth.",

  "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a promising paradigm to relieve the overload on corresponding edge servers by utilising the idle resources of nearby vehicles. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles, the vehicles perhaps drive out of the communication range of user equipments (UEs) during task processing. Therefore, it is important to select the appropriate vehicles as service nodes. In this paper, we propose a task offloading and resource allocation scheme for UEs near the intersection. We first study the availability of vehicles according to characteristics movement of vehicles at the intersection. Then, considering the delay constraint of tasks, and the computing capacity of vehicles and the edge server, a double deep Q-network approach is adopted to obtain the optimal policy of task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better performance in improving the average utility of UEs and task success rate.",

  "abstract": "Efficient data sharing in autonomous driving is expected to improve road safety. However, time-varying network topologies, limited roadside unit (RSU) coverage, and communication limitations make efficient data sharing challenging. Therefore, we propose an RSU-assisted hybrid scheduling (RAHC) scheme, including centralised scheduling within the RSU and self-organised scheduling in the RSU blind zone. For centralised scheduling, we model data transmission and transmission conflicts as conflict graph based on real-time network topology, and solve for optimal transmission paths while satisfying communication constraints, and increase the chance for vehicles in RSU blind areas to obtain data by carrying and forwarding data. For self-organised scheduling, we use degree of link similarity (DLS) to cluster vehicles and select the vehicle with the largest service capacity (SC) in the cluster to serve the opposite vehicle. This reduces duplication and redundancy of data transmission and improves sharing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the solution.",

  "abstract": "As an important node of a multimodal container transport hub, the container terminal occupies a critical position in the whole process of container transportation and the global supply chain network. With the increasing size of container vessels, improving the handling efficiency of multiple vessels at berth in a given port becomes a complex problem to solve. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model to minimise the vessel services time, the total completion and travel times of quay cranes (QCs) among multiple vessels. To solve the proposed model, we develop a particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm incorporated with a tailored initial-solution generation algorithm. Furthermore, a couple of acceleration strategies are designed to improve the solution quality and shorten computation time. The results of numerical experiments on real-life instances validate the proposed model and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

The empirical data was acquired from the national accounts for 1995-2015 in Australia and for 1998-2012 in Finland. This data was averaged for a cross-sectional comparison of industries and then for the two countries. Different industries' advancement in digitalisation seems to follow approximately the same pacing in both countries. Financial and insurance services, telecommunications and media, and professional, technical and scientific services are the most active digitalisers. The empirical testing of the a priori assumption that digitalisation over a long period of time leads to greater productivity shows that the observed correlation between information and communication technology (ICT) investment and productivity is weak. The results partly confirm Solow's productivity paradox.",

Recently, researchers have found that there is a growing limitation in the meeting of the computing and network bandwidths for the cloud when supported systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are used. Instead of establishing channels for the cloud storage and utilisation, edge-centric computing places some of the processes and resources near to the users; however, its utilisation has raised security concerns about the data usage, and the existing secure mechanisms in the cloud are no longer suitable for data protection at the edge. In this paper, the security issues of cloud data at the edge are studied.

  "abstract": "These days, more and more web are converting into mobile devices such as the internet of things (IoT). These applications are distributed in nature and installed on mobile and servers to achieve many business goals. With this motivation, mobile edge computing (MEC) is an evolving paradigm that reduces the energy consumption of mobile devices through the offload process. However, currently all studies only concentrated on mobile energy and widely overlooked the energy usage of the computing node resources and application deadlines during offloading and scheduling in the MEC network. This research suggests a new mobile edge cloud (mob-cloud) architecture that minimises the nodes energy and meets the deadline requirements of applications. This research formulates this problem as the convex optimisation problem under linear integer programming. The mob-cloud consists of different types of virtual machines which are implementing at the edge computing. This study introduces a novel deadline and energy-efficient task scheduling (DEETS) algorithm framework consisting of task sequencing, resource searching, and mobility-aware scheduling. Furthermore, DEETS keeps tradeoff performances between resource energy usage and task deadline. Simulation results show that the proposed DEETS outperformed all contemporary methods regarding energy usage and deadlines of applications by 50%.",

  "abstract": "Women entrepreneurs confronted with several obstacles while managing their business houses and dealt firmly developing successful ventures over time. The long term sustainability of their business reflects their entrepreneurial skills. The existence of certain forces empowered entrepreneurial drive of women entrepreneurs leading to their satisfaction and engagement in their ventures. The present investigation evaluated the antecedents of women's entrepreneurial satisfaction by examining 405 women entrepreneur participants using confirmatory factor analysis and cluster analysis techniques. This study comprises only micro and small businesses of women. The non-monetary determinants emerged out as the significant determinants of satisfaction of women entrepreneurs. The results revealed four clusters of women entrepreneurs based on motivational theory such as micro-achievers, entrepreneurial team, liberal and socialist feminism and optimism. The results also indicated that the clusters of women entrepreneurs' respond distinctively towards various dimensions of entrepreneurial satisfaction, i.e., quality of married life, overall venture satisfaction, achieved innovation, achieved freedom, team orientation, achieved recognition and identity and achieved employee trust.",

  "abstract": "E-health applications are one of the most promising applications in the context of internet of things (IoT). Nevertheless, resource constraints and security issues in IoT are the main barriers for their deployment. Among security issues, authentication and data confidentiality are required to secure e-health applications. In this paper, we propose a new authentication and key agreement scheme for e-health applications in the context of IoT. This scheme allows a sensor node, a gateway node, and a remote user to authenticate each other and secure the collection of health-related data. The proposed scheme is based on lightweight symmetric cryptography since it uses nonces, exclusive-or operations, and simple hash functions. Besides, it takes into consideration the sensors location to provide an efficient authentication. To assess the proposed scheme, we conduct a theoretical and an automated security analysis using AVISPA tool. The results show that our scheme preserves the security properties, and ensures resilience against different types of attacks. In addition, we evaluate and compare both communication and computational costs with some existing authentication schemes. The obtained results prove that it provides authentication with low energy cost.",

  "abstract": "European Journal of International Management (EJIM) is one of the leading journals in the field of international business. Despite its leading status, the journal, to date, has not been retrospectively reviewed. Therefore, the aim of this article is to commemorate EJIM' 15th anniversary with an in-depth and comprehensive review of the journal's knowledge output. Using bibliometric analysis, we find that EJIM has grown immensely in terms of its impact, with consistent growth in its citations. In line with its European slant, most articles published in EJIM originate from Europe. In terms of methodology, the journal has moved from empirical qualitative to empirical quantitative research. The bibliometric findings show six prominent themes that include internationalisation in entrepreneurial ventures and small and medium enterprises, competencies of multinational firms, strategic management in international business, international human resource management, national culture and organisational culture. Though the major focus of the EJIM' initial years was on international human resource management, it has more recently shifted its focus to internationalisation strategies involving entrepreneurial ventures and Small- and Medium-Enterprises (SMEs). The insights from this retrospective review should be useful to the editors and editorial board members in appreciating the achievements of EJIM and shape its future.",

The current work aims to explore the influence of formal and informal institutional avoidance, adaption, and co-evolution factors for the inflow of FDI as perceived by the MNEs working in KSA as an evolutionary approach to international business. The data was collected from the British MNEs working in KSA and was analysed with logistic regression. The study results suggest the formal institutional avoidance and adaptation factors significantly influence the inflow of FDI as perceived by the MNEs working in KSA. While the formal institutional co-evolution factors insignificantly influence the FDI in KSA. For the informal institutional factors, only informal avoidance significantly influences the FDI in KSA.",

  "abstract": "With cloud storage, users can store their data files on a remote cloud server with a high quality on-demand cloud service and are able to share their data with other users. Since cloud servers usually are not regarded as fully trusted and the cloud data can be shared amongst users, the integrity checking of the remote files has become an important issue. A number of remote data integrity checking protocols have been proposed in the literature to allow public auditing of cloud data by a third party auditor (TPA). However, user privacy is not taken into account in most of the existing protocols. We believe that preserving the anonymity (i.e., identity privacy) of the data owner is also very important in many applications. In this paper, we propose a new remote integrity checking scheme which allows the cloud server to protect the identity information of the data owner against the TPA. We also define a formal security model to capture the requirement of user anonymity, and prove the anonymity of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we improve the existing security model for data privacy against the TPA, and show that an extended version of our protocol is secure under the strengthened security model.",

  "abstract": "Chacha is a software-oriented stream cipher designed by Bernstein (2008). Chacha is a Salsa variant that is eSTREAM project's finalist candidate. Google added Chacha and a message authentication code to their transport layer security (TLS) and datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols in 2016. Chacha has become an area of interest for cryptanalysis since its adoption by Google. Almost all the existing cryptanalysis is experimental. Experimental cryptanalysis identifies vulnerable areas of a cipher, whereas theoretical analysis helps in the development of possible countermeasures. Differential cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic technique that helps in discovering distinguishers on stream ciphers. Recently, Dey and Sarkar (2021) have theoretically explored the reason behind distinguishers in Salsa and Chacha 256 stream cipher. Motivated by this work, we have theoretically analysed differential attacks on Chacha 128 (Chacha 256 variant) up to four rounds and we have the bias probabilities. Our theoretical analysis results match the experimental results.",

  "abstract": "New technologies, sustainability policies, protectionism and consumers preferences are pushing for the reorganisation of the automotive cluster. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to create disruptive effects in the employment systems across the world. The future deployment of broad-spectrum algorithms capable of being used in wide areas of application (e.g., industrial robotics, software and data communication) can lead to considerable changes in current work patterns, swiftly render many unemployed across the globe and profoundly destabilise labour relations. In this paper, we identify the probable penetration of AI in the automotive sector and to study its effects on work organisation, employment, and industrial relations systems, in Portugal. These changes are put in place to enhance the product quality, control costs, and improve productivity. We study these implications on productivity and industrial relations collecting new data and obtain results based on secondary statistical analyses and case studies in the automotive industry. Finally, changes in the productivity and labour market will be discussed considering the employment and skills changes in the automotive sector when investment on automation becomes a clear trend in the automotive sector.",

This study proposed mixed methods of bibliometric analysis and spatial analysis to scan driving forces at the generic and place-based level. Critical uncertainties result from prioritising driving forces, which were used in framing scenarios. The four scenario quadrants in cross-impact analysis are formed by the intersection of two axes: the degree of government intervention and the degree of integration of mobility solutions. The results shed light on inherent mobility inequality issues and challenges in engaging a diverse range of stakeholders. The paper concludes with proposed strategic implications covering institutions, incentives, and infrastructures that contribute to social benefit, uphold market freedom, and support the emergence of urban mobility innovations.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Banking, Accounting and Finance",
  "abstract": "Various researchers have examined the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) and performance of banks. Yet, only few studies have examined the nexus between IC and bank efficiency especially in Africa. Using the VAIC™ model of Pulic (2000) [and its additive components human capital efficiency (HCE), structural capital efficiency (SCE) and capital employed efficiency (CEE)] to measure IC and data envelopment analysis to estimate efficiency scores, the current study used Ghanaian data of 32 banks from 2000 to 2015 to examine the nexus. The study found that risk-adjusted efficiency scores are higher than non-risk adjusted scores. There is evidence suggesting that IC instigates efficiency in banks. This is borne largely from HCE suggesting the prevalence of the human capital theory. The results of the impact of SCE and CEE are insignificant except for the significant positive impact of CEE on profit efficiency. Stock exchange listing increases efficiency scores especially risk-adjusted efficiency. Other exogenous variables such as size, leverage and concentration were controlled for with the results discussed into detail. The results have implications for bank regulation, bank management and future research.",

A fit-viability model (FVM) is used as the analytical framework for the study. An interpretive, qualitative methodology, employing the use of a case study of the ports in South Africa was adopted. The interview data collected was analysed thematically and the findings revealed several insights: the first is that a digitalised BCM architecture 'fits' the cloud computing model. Secondly, the cloud computing model is a 'viable' model that can contribute to managing complex and differentiated organisations. For such complex organisations, viability can be realised by harnessing collective intelligence (CI) for more effective BCM. Lastly, to realise digitally enabled BCM and harness the power of CI, there is need for a rethinking of strategy towards the adoption of an 'intelliport strategy' or 'smart' BCM for ports.",

  "abstract": "During the past decade, considerable improved versions of real particle swarm optimisation (PSO) have been proposed in the literature. However, only a few significant improved versions of binary PSO (BPSO) have been reported. For efficiently solving binary optimisation problems, this paper proposes an improved-BPSO technique in which an improved idea for updating particles' velocity is proposed. To escape from the local optimum, an on/off mutation strategy is also introduced. Thereafter, the proposed strategy is utilised to solve two reduced knapsack cryptosystems. For a fair assessment of the proposed technique two relatively new methods are also utilised, namely, novel-BPSO and modified-BPSO. This paper also proposes an improved genetic algorithm (improved-GA) for solving the considered knapsack cryptosystems. Finally, the experimental results are analysed by performing f-test and t-test. The outcomes obtained indicate that the improved-GA and improved-BPSO strategies solve the considered automated cryptanalysis problem efficiently in terms of accuracy and convergence.",

  "abstract": "Business intelligence (BI) is a broad category of business information system that plays a vital role in decision making. Traditional BI systems are designed to support for decision making to strategic users. The components in the traditional BI system are limited analytical functionality and lack of monitoring of business performance, alert engine, self-service reports, operational analytics and decision models capabilities. Further, the need and usage of BI systems for operational decision making have significantly increased for a timely decision to all users in the organisations. Operational BI is not a merely a combination of operational and BI systems, but they constitute the whole complex components that cover overall functionalities from storage, process, monitor, visualise and delivering information to form an ecosystem. In this paper, the key components of an operational BI ecosystem are presented, and their workings explained. The methodology adopted for key component identification is based on modularity using cohesion and coupling parameters of software engineering. The proposed key components of the system are operational analytics, event notification monitoring, business performance management, operational reports and the portal. An orderly arrangement of these key components constitutes an operational BI ecosystem.",

  "abstract": "Modern information systems are expected to respond to a wide variety of information needs from users with diverse goals. The topical dimension ('what' the user is searching for) of these information needs is well studied; however, the intent dimension ('why' the user is searching) has received relatively less attention. Traditionally, the intent is an immediate reason, purpose, or goal that motivates the user search, and captured in search contexts (pre-search, in-search, pro-search). An ideal information system would be able to use. This article proposed a novel intent estimation strategy, based on the intuition that captured intent proactively extracts potential results. Captured pre-search context adapts query term proximities within matched results beside document-terms statistics and pseudo-relevance feedback with user-relevance feedback for in-search. The assessment asserts the superior performance of the proposed strategy over equivalent on trade-offs, e.g., novelty, diversity (coverage, topicality), retrieval (precision, recall, F-measure) and exploitation vs. exploration.",

  "abstract": "The interoperability of systems is a critical factor for firms to make informed operational and strategic decisions and achieve a competitive edge in the marketplace. As a result, open systems that have a higher level of interoperability with secured and stable operations have significant relevance in today's global economy. Interoperability is accomplished through appropriate system architecture and design. Thus, to achieve the open system interoperability, this paper proposes a framework that looks at the system architecture at various levels of abstraction/implementation and identifies the required attributes at each of these levels. This framework can be used as a reference to analyse and determine interoperability requirements at all levels and prioritise the required aspects of interoperability.",

By now, there has been no radical evolution in the way Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) processes are conducted for decades. The aim of this research is to analyse if and how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to increase efficiency and effectiveness in M&A transactions. The work is based on the one hand on the respective literature on AI and on M&A and on the other hand on a survey of experts from the financial services industry. The results show that respondents see the greatest opportunities for AI in the M&A process in increasing efficiency and precision. Limitations of the application arise regarding data conformity, data protection and the technical reproducibility of emotional intelligence. Overall, this paper shows which realistic approaches exist for AI in the M&A process and how this technology can lead to an increase in effectiveness and efficiency.",

  "abstract": "The continuous development of information technology in social needs has promoted the development of the mobile game industry, making games an important cultural and entertainment consumer product. The game industry became a huge dividend market. However, the booming game industry is highly competitive. How to maintain its competitiveness has become an urgent problem to be solved. This research aims at the related factors that affect users' game stickiness, such as user-perceived quality, switching cost, and perceived ease of use are focused as the primary concerns of this research. Combining the characteristics of games and users' behaviour, a structural equation model is constructed. Through the questionnaire survey and structural equation analysis, it is found that sociality, payment mechanism, user interface and plot have positive effects on game stickiness. Finally, based on the idea of behavioural design and the analysis results, this paper proposed some systematic improvement strategies for game stickiness.",

A growing body of research investigates privacy threats related to big data analytics, but their implications for democracy are still scarcely explored. Focusing on the democratic value of privacy, we identify privacy threats for citizens stemming from the use of big data in e-government and e-democracy applications. We analyse the challenges for e-government arguing among others that automatic decision-making may lead to discrimination compromising equality, a basic democratic value. We also explore the challenges of the privacy threats for e-democracy, arguing that decreased privacy facilitates manipulation, polarisation and disinformation. Finally, we critically examine relevant technical privacy enhancing solutions which may play a significant role in shielding democracy through allowing citizens to freely share, access and discuss information and content that is contrary to political, religious or social views of governments.",

To this end, we employ an in-depth single case study to examine the participation architecture of the platform as well as the Hyperloop campaign content, based on which we derive a new crowdfunding model. The derived crowdfunding model differs from existing crowdfunding models in that it allows entrepreneurs to develop their business with the crowdmore actively. Our research has important implications for research and practice. First, we introduce a new crowdfunding model that expands the boundaries of existent models. Second, we explain how our model helps to more efficiently leverage the potential inherent in the crowd thereby redefining entrepreneurial success within crowdfunding. Third, we discuss how our findings contribute to existent research within the context of crowdsourcing.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Entrepreneurial Venturing",
  "abstract": "Digital technologies inherently change entrepreneurial processes and outcomes. One theoretical perspective that aims at explaining both is the creation view of opportunities, which proposes iterative social interaction between entrepreneurs and interested stakeholders and the evolutionary nature of opportunities as idiosyncratic. While the discussion on the phenomena of crowdsourcing is scarce in entrepreneurship research on opportunity (co-) creation, it provides enormous potential for the field. Within this paper, we focus on providing a theoretical rational for why and how collective intelligence and crowdsourcing as concrete mechanism works for improving the entrepreneurial cognition process. The paper shows that entrepreneurs can leverage collective intelligence to objectify opportunities by starting a sense making process, persuading interested stakeholders, and mobilising external resources, thus limiting the cognitive constraints and bounds of entrepreneurial agents. We thus contribute to the discourse about how opportunities emerge from interactions between entrepreneurs and their social environment and provide an agenda that may guide future research in the field of digital entrepreneurship.",

  "abstract": "The diversity of services, prices, and geographical footprints has turned the clouds into a complex and heterogeneous environment. Moreover, the survivability and reliability aspects are often disregarded by tenants, eventually resulting in heavy losses due to unavailability of services that are hosted on Virtual Infrastructures (VIs). We present an alternative to improve Vis' survivability and reliability, which considers the use of replicas and the spreading of virtual resources atop providers, regions, and zones. We formulate the VI allocation with survivability and reliability requirements as a mixed integer program, and three strategies to solve the formulation are proposed. First, the binary constraints are relaxed to obtain a Linear Program (LP), and the LP solution is given as input for the simulated annealing technique. Then, two GPU-accelerated algorithms are proposed to speed up the allocation of large-scale scenarios. Simulation with different reliability requests indicate an increasing in survivability without inflating costs.",

  "abstract": "Early exponential growth of any influenza pandemic is a result of heterogeneous population, where susceptible with high human contact may have spread the disease. The cases of ten worst infected states in India due to SARS-CoV-2 as of 9 June 2020 are modelled to find the number of super-spreaders. We propose the use of model considering heterogeneous population and non-pharmaceutical measures during lockdown considerations from 25 March 2020 to 31 May 2020 for the state-specific transmission dynamics. A fixed sample of population element is measured before the COVID-19 outbreak. The impact of social distancing and personal hygiene through the empirical research is observed. We incorporated the behaviour change in the models. Our results indicate that the vulnerability is high in Bihar, while the conditions in Delhi, UP and West Bengal may deteriorate in the near future. We highlight that policy of testing, social distancing and personal hygiene should be continued.",

  "abstract": "The Indian economy is growing and has a huge potential market with ability to garner wide businesses due to unique business environment and reforms from the government. The economic indicator of comparative gross domestic products has indicated the accelerated growth for India from the last decade. Currently, Indian IT firms are targeting newer business domains with wide and newer footprints across the globe with acquiring new subsidiaries and incorporating new partnerships to fuel this growth. Moreover, Indian IT-ITES industry has a lower debt to equity profile and analysis of stocks is considered as safe investment. Therefore, it becomes essential to study and access the state of financial health in the industry. In this paper, the Indian IT-ITES industry is analysed with the help of financial metrics and standard models of Altman Z-score and Piotroski F-score to compare performance, predict solvency of companies, test the strength of the companies and foresee the future of Indian IT-ITES industry.",

  "abstract": "Numerous use cases exist in industrial practice in which data availability, up-to-dateness, accessibility and volume are insufficient to solve time-critical problems optimally. One example is bottleneck management (BM) in the automotive industry, where information is often time-delayed and incomplete. Time-critical volume coverage for supply risks leads to the question of how and where to obtain the information. Improved data accuracy therefore enables faster and more precise decisions. The literature offers approaches for the use of social media (SM) for risk assessment, which are reviewed regarding their suitability for transfer to BM in the automotive industry. Adapted from a multiple-cases study, this paper presents the first application of using external data generated by SM formats and develops a new, obstacle mitigated method of SM-knowledge-based BM. The goal of this study is to apply SM in the BM of the automotive industry and, hence, to enhance the typical current BM process.",

  "abstract": "Adopting an emerging technology such as IIoT is a complex process with high risks and failure rate. Therefore, a profound understanding of readiness factors and interrelationships prior to adoption is essential for manufactures. This paper proposes a model framework of the causal relationships of the readiness factors for IIoT adoption using decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-based rough set theory (RST). DEMATEL is to identify the interrelationships among readiness factors, while RST is to capture the ambiguity and subjective information in the decision-making process. The proposed framework is illustrated by taking a case of Thai agro-food processing industry. The finding suggests that the Thai agro-food processing industry needs to focus on three main readiness factors being 'top management support and commitment', 'digital business model' and 'strategic technology roadmap for digitalisation', respectively. This study also provides a deep insight to adopt IIoT for better understanding of the essential readiness factors.",

  "abstract": "The paper studies the stock market reaction of 88 regional intelligent logistics policies (RILPs) for Chinese logistics companies from 2013-2020. First, we find the stock market reaction of RILPs is positive. Second, combined with fundamental analysis theory (FAT), this research discusses the stock market reaction from macro factors, industry factors, and micro factors. For macro factors, when the per capita GDP of province is worse or its information service revenue is better, the market reaction of RILP is more positive. For industry factors, the worse the logistics industry added values are, the more positive the reaction of RILPs is. For micro factors, an RILP has a more positive impact on the smaller enterprises. Finally, we compare the market reactions of polices issued by provincial governments (which is RILPs) with those of central-government intelligent logistics policies (CILPs), and the effects of RILPs are more positive.",

  "abstract": "Middle of life (MOL) of complex engineering products involves various groups of stakeholders. Products are getting smarter. Furthermore, there is a trend to offer complex engineering products in combination with services. This trend changes current roles of stakeholders in MOL and enables new ones. Existing literature so far lacks a systematic and extensive analysis of the stakeholders within MOL. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are to identify stakeholders in MOL; identify and model relationships among the stakeholders; identify data and information needs of stakeholders and propose appropriate techniques for data analytics to support accomplishment of stakeholders' needs. These objectives are realised by conducting literature survey and interviews. This research focuses on two case studies: offshore wind turbines and commercial airplanes. The paper achieves a systematic perspective on potential stakeholders of MOL and their relationships. Moreover, it proposes supporting approaches for data analytics to satisfy information needs of the stakeholders.",

  "abstract": "Environmental concerns are increasingly demanding for sustainable consumption of Earth's resources. The adoption of the circular economy model can potentially address the environmental sustainability challenge, but there is a need to revolutionise the way products are developed. This work aims to explore the current scientific literature related to the open product development process in support of sustainability, with a major focus on circular economy, and propose a framework to address the main obstacle emerged from it. More than 130 research articles have been scanned, and more than 50 have been deeply analysed. One of the main gaps discovered in the studied literature is the lack of shared information about materials. For this reason, we propose a framework for the establishment of a digital identity of materials by means of cyber-physical systems employed along the material lifecycle. In this way, material-related information in all the lifecycle phases can be collected and stored in a material passport to increase value chain transparency and allow resources traceability. Sharing material passports in a digital platform would form an internet of materials that would support designers and engineers in developing more sustainable products.",

  "abstract": "This paper explores approaches to governance of supply risks beyond first-tier suppliers and factors that contribute to a firm choosing a particular approach. A multiple-case design was deployed to compare and evaluate firms with diverse characteristics. Data collected from six firms were coded, categorised, and aggregated into a delineation framework. The framework identifies four dynamic approaches that procurement managers can apply in governance of supply risks beyond first-tier suppliers, namely control, cooperate, trust and neglect. The choice of each approach is due to particular antecedent factors such as focal firm's ability to influence a first-tier supplier, its capability to manage risks in lower tiers, the ability of the first-tier supplier to manage risks in lower tiers, and trust between the focal firm and their first-tier supplier. The paper argues that procurement managers should primarily aim for the cooperation approach.",

  "abstract": "New innovative business model, changes in wholesale and customers' needs and behaviour, and food safety issues force businesses in agri-food sector to develop a digital transformation strategy. As many of them are well-established organisations existing resources, capabilities, organisations experience, and financial resources are important parameters that are considered. Based on dynamic capabilities and digital transformation literature we proposed a research model that aligns digital transformation and could be an enabler for a successful digital transformation. To test our research model, we adopt a qualitative approach that is based on in-depth interviews of key respondents such as CEOs, owners, and managers of three incumbent agri-food businesses active in the Thessaloniki surrounding area. We explore how existing resources and capabilities, managerial perception, organisational beliefs, and identity affect the digital transformation process and if the proposed implementation initiatives enable agri-food businesses to easily implement the digital transformation strategy. The paper aims to propose a digital transformation framework that not only empirically helps managers easily implement a digital transformation strategy but also will add theoretical value to the existing literature about digital transformation as it proposes and tests a digital transformation framework that is based on businesses' capabilities.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents Group-IKEv2, a group key management protocol supporting secure group communication based on multicast IPsec. Group-IKEv2 is an adaptation of the IKEv2 protocol for the IPsec suite, and is especially designed to address internet of things (IoT) scenarios composed of resource-constrained devices. Compared to static approaches, Group-IKEv2 enables dynamic and flexible establishment of IPsec group security associations as well as group key material. Also, it integrates the management and renewal of group key material, both on a periodical fashion and upon group membership changes. We have implemented Group-IKEv2 for the Contiki OS and tested it on the OpenMote resource-constrained platform. Our experimental performance evaluation confirms that Group-IKEv2 is affordable and deployable also on constrained IoT devices.",

  "abstract": "Multimodal machine learning is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field and achieved much attention due to its wide range of applications. A research problem is multimodal, for the impact of privacy preservation. It shields sensitive data in the cloud by using a single modality-based privacy system. The user's biometric features are always stored in the database, primarily present in the cloud server to validate the user and his access. This facet provides a beneficial quality but at the same time has raised crucial affairs in security and privacy of biometric feature set. The main concern is to manage and stop the privacy breaches in clouds. The article discusses the detailed analysis of security schemes with a multimodal-based learning framework over sensitive data and systems at both ends. The article also accentuates frameworks and schemes that may apply in various applications to ensure privacy preservation of individuals and data security by multimodal algorithms.",

  "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to investigate banks' perception of Fintech growth in Nigeria and how such growth affects their ICT investment decisions. Fintech has brought to the forefront the significance of ICT by providing traditional banking services, which were hitherto the exclusive rights of incumbent banks. This has made banks to increase their ICT expenditure by investing heavily in digital banking and on accelerators, alliances and innovation laboratories. Guided by the Sense and Respond theory, an in-depth interview was conducted and later transcribed manually without the use of any software. The analysis of the findings revealed that Fintechs are both threat and opportunity to Nigerian banks and are impacting positively on their ICT investment decisions. Finally, this study recommends further research on the effectiveness of banks' ICT investments decisions in containing the growth of Fintech in Nigeria.",

  "abstract": "Despite the increasing importance of online labour markets (OLMs) in service economy, the majority of them transact only simple tasks, without the capability to facilitate knowledge-intensive ones because of their intangibility and subjective nature. Drawing on the service productisation literature, this exploratory case study examines how a leading OLM successfully facilitated a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks such as website and logo design. We developed a process model of service productisation on OLMs, which consists of three stages, service concretisation, process standardisation, and objective assessment. Each stage involves a set of regulating mechanisms for service packaging, transaction process management, and dispute arbitration, respectively, in addition to digital tools, to create product properties for services. We conclude that the regulating mechanisms and digital tools are essential to transact knowledge-intensive tasks on OLMs.",

The fundamental core of C2C2B lies in the presence of the community, which bridges the consumer and the business, facilitates transaction, and expands trade volumes. According to the study's findings, 'group buying' and 'internet celebrity' are essential categories of this model. Given the novelty and the potential of the C2C2B business model, the study aims to examine its feasibility. To this end, a two-fold approach is adopted to investigate the key success factors that a social media community must possess for the implementation of the C2C2B business model, with consideration for its sustainability. The study also conducted an experiment to create a community that fits into the C2C2B concept.",

This paper proposes a development process of an adaptable composed web service and mainly focuses on the reliability and the performance properties. It explores the model driven architecture transformation technique in order to formally model the whole service orchestration using the timed coloured Petri net formalism. The software CPN Tools offers, among others, the ASK-computational tree logic, the model checking technique and several monitors that will be exploited to describe and verify different properties at design time. They will also be used via access/CPN library in order to reason about the reconfiguration technique at runtime. An example of an identity card management process is given to prove the feasibility of the proposed solution.",

  "abstract": "Crowdsourcing with intelligent agent felicitated with portable smart devices is popularly known as mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) or participatory sensing (PS). To motivate the task executors for performing the available tasks has been a challenge in an MCS environment. In this paper we have addressed this issue in a double auction environment when the tasks are time restricted (each task has start time and finish time) and may be overlapped. Here, we have taken an egalitarian approach so that a balanced allocation of tasks can be established to the task executors. In this, first the tasks are partitioned into several slots in a non-overlapping manner and then allocated to the task executors through double auction. Our proposed mechanism satisfies several economic properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget balanced. It is also exhibited via simulation that our proposed mechanism performs better when the agents (task executors and task providers) misreport their valuations.",

  "abstract": "Global financial industry is facing recent emergence of digital transformation and technology innovations, especially financial technology in banking sector. Yet, previous studies have not provided sufficient models to assess this 'FinTech Revolution'. The current study, therefore, addressed this limitation by proposing a conceptual model for FinTech adoption by retail banks in Bahrain and Egypt. The proposed model is based on triangulation of technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework and diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory. The model was empirically tested using a sample of 305 senior and mid-career bank employees in both countries. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to identify the underlying relationships between variables resulting in validating and developing two versions of the proposed 'FinTech Adoption' conceptual model, thus reflecting differences between the studied countries. Stepwise regression was used to answer research hypotheses and measure the true impact on FinTech Adoption, followed by T-test and ANOVA to assess the impact of moderating variables.",

Thus, this study investigated the factors involved in effective long-term relationship management to enhance value co-creation among business partners through four variable factor elements: organisational management, partner characteristics, resource sharing, and market orientation. The quantitative data was collected from 500 executives in Thailand's business sector using a questionnaire; the data was analysed through descriptive, inference, and multivariate statistics, CFA, S-CFA, and SEM using the techniques for cutting off variable factors. The hypothesis test results showed that the focus of businesses in the industrial sector and service-sector businesses concerning the factors involved statistically significant differences. The empirical results theoretically contribute to developing guidelines for long-term relationship management and have managerial implications for the value co-creation among business partners.",

  "abstract": "Approximately 70% of the food consumed in Brazil comes from family farming, mainly composed of small farmers. Small farmers are especially active in the fruits and vegetables (FV) chains in Brazil and were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to the degradation in the country's food security. This paper explores how social innovation in the FV sector can contribute to social-ecological systems resilience and supply chain resilience, using as the main theoretical background the adaptive cycle framework. The article was based on documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews, exploring the FV sector issues at a macro-level and then focusing on the case study of Sumá, a social enterprise from Southern Brazil. Sumá develops small farmers and connects them to regular food purchasers in small towns, promoting sustainable food systems. This case study stands out as an example of how to identify, evaluate and take advantage of market opportunities and public sector gaps in order to generate economic growth and multidimensional social impact.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine the effect of Arab cultural dimensions on employees' adoption of e-government services by adaptation of the cultural dimensions concept as theorised by the Hofstede cultural model and nepotism as well as face-to-face interactions as derived from literature review. This study developed and examined a model that contributes to the scholarly research on e-government and information systems. The study used a survey that was administered to 137 Saudi administrative employees at hospital King Fahad of the Al-Baha emirate region in the Saudi Arabia. The data was analysed employing a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach through partial least square (PLS) software. The results revealed that high power distance, low uncertainty avoidance, high collectivism, high masculinity, face-to-face interactions, and nepotism contributed positively to employees' adoption of e-government services in public sector organisations. The study also helps public sector organisations to understand the effect of the cultural dimension on e-government adoption. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

  "abstract": "Although handling missing data and missing value imputation are widely researched subjects, missing data identification and treatment has not been pursued as a principal apparatus in retail data science applications. Critical data science derived strategies for assortment optimisation, customer purchasing behaviour and supply chain draw conclusions mostly based on the assumptions of non-missing, complete datasets. Therefore, we not only explore missing data scenarios in retail holistically: 1) from a data science perspective; 2) from an operational perspective; 3) from an implementation perspective, such that we can develop a robust framework, but also, we fill the gaps in: 1) identification; 2) treatment of missing data. To make our recommendations robust and comprehensive, we have proposed an implementable framework that harnesses the missing data scenarios in retail holistically and bridges the gaps in identification and treatment of it. At the core of the framework is a decision tree conjoining systematically derived two options trees, one from the retail industry operations and the other from the spectrum of missing data methods in the realm of data science.",

  "abstract": "Smart environment scenarios are characterised by the presence of users, with different needs and preferences, and everyday life objects exploited to meet the expectations of users themselves. Connecting objects to the internet and making them accessible from remote is not sufficient to make an environment 'smart' since such ecosystems should also be able to enable context-sensitive actions along with a management of the interaction between objects and users. In this work, we propose GOOSE, a platform which aimed at interpreting users goals expressed in natural language in order to generate, select, and safely enforce a set of plans to be executed to fulfill target goals. After highlighting the main challenges affecting typical machine-to-machine (M2M) communication scenarios, we show how the use of a semantic reasoner can be used to allow the composition of plans consisting of sequences of services to be called on the smart environment objects. Finally, we address the issue of secure communications between platform and objects, and the management of potentially inconsistent goals.",

  "abstract": "The current paper aims to identify the individual competencies of collaborators in Industry 4.0 projects. We used the Delphi method with three rounds as a research methodology. Sixty-three experts engaged with Industry 4.0 projects, professionals and academics, participated in the study. A set of individual competencies related to Industry 4.0 was identified: 1) technical (technical skills, systemic process comprehension, IT security skills, project management tendency, analytical skills, and business knowledge); 2) personal (flexibility, learning motivation, decision-making, ambiguity tolerance, and ability to work under pressure); 3) methodological (creativity, digital mindset, and entrepreneur thinking); 4) social aspects (communication skills, team-working skills, being committed and proactive, conflict resolution, and leadership skills). The findings led to a list of competencies for project managers and other team members in the Industry 4.0' context. This result provides new insights related to personnel development in project-managed environments and educational guidance for the future workforce.",

  "abstract": "Enterprise Application Integration area seeks to support the companies' business processes by enabling data and functionality of the applications to become reusable. Integration platforms are tools that develop and execute integration processes. This execution is done by a key component of the platforms called run-time system; that said, the performance from integration processes heavily depends on the efficiency of the run-time system. The task-based execution model implemented by the run-time system can use a strategy based on local pools to store computational threads associated with each task that make up the workflow of the integration process, in order to execute them. The challenge in this strategy is to evenly distribute the threads in each pool, minimising the makespan. We propose an experimental study, which uses two meta-heuristics to find the best distribution with the optimal number of threads. We compared both Particle Swarm Optimisation and Cat Swarm Optimisation, with the latter showing better results.",

  "abstract": "Cloud federation is a concept that collectively combines segregated cloud services to create an extended pool of resources for clouds to competently deliver their promised level of services. This paper studies the governing aspects of cloud federation through collaborative networking. It proposes a network of federated clouds, CloudLend, that creates a platform for cloud providers to collaborate, and for customers to expand their service selections. We design a service level agreement (SLA) management model to govern and administer the relationships between different cloud services. We define a multi-level SLA specification model to describe QoS terms, in addition to a game theory-based automated SLA negotiation model. We define an adaptive agent-based SLA monitoring model. Formal verification proved that our framework assures customers with maximum optimised QoS guarantees, in addition to supporting cloud providers to make informed resource utilisation decisions. Additionally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLA management model.",

  "abstract": "The Android operating system constitutes a very attracting platform for developing smart applications providing various services to the users, including the field of e-governance. This provision comes along with personal data processing, which in turn raises several privacy concerns. This paper studies privacy issues in the mobile ecosystem, focusing on two important types of smart applications which process personal data to a large extent: global positioning system (GPS) navigators and fitness tracking applications. More precisely, for both types of applications, an indicative list of popular apps is being analysed through appropriate experimental environment, aiming to identify the underlying personal data processing that takes place. Our analysis illustrates that both GPS navigation apps and fitness trackers have access to several types of users data, while they may allow for personal data leakage towards third parties such as library providers or tracking services without providing always adequate or precise information to the users.",

  "abstract": "With the move towards more 'outcome' and 'value'-based treatment regimens – increasingly tailored for the individual patient – there is growing pressure on healthcare systems and the pharmaceutical sector to collaborate and co-develop innovative models of care and medication. This paper focuses on the impact disruptive digital technologies may have on the UK Pharma/National Health Service (NHS) ecosystem. Underpinned by the literature on digital/IoT-based business models and product-service systems (PSS), a conceptual model for designing more 'connected' value networks is developed and validated by an expert panel. Applying the model, we assess emerging PSS concepts and scenarios involving more distributed 'make-to-order' service models - demonstrating the potential for technologies, such as 3D printing, to enable localised and personalised medication manufacture. The model reduces complexity and serves to provide practical guidance on future operating principles and protocols to be used in the design and implementation of improved e-healthcare solutions.",

Adaptive reuse of cultural heritage is considered today as key in urban conservation and sustainable development. This article addresses the relevance of adaptive reuse of cultural heritage to the circular economy objectives. It then suggests an innovative business model which can cope with specific issues of governance and financing processes of adaptive reuse. It is based on the strongly sustainable business ontology and it is related to the flourishing business model, which takes into consideration the multi-dimensional and multi-actors context of sustainability. By building on this model, the paper analyses the different sections (how, what, for whom and why) under the framework of the circular economy.",

  "abstract": "This paper illustrates the cloud-based services on next generation smart living technology, first by providing the concept of smart technology of the next generation, followed by the wide area of application in this sector. Next, the current generation technological enhancement, IoT (Internet of Things) is brought into the smart living. The entire IoT-based Smart Application sector has then been divided into five categories: Power and Energy Sector, Transport Sector, Healthcare Sector, Retail Sector and Education Sector. Each sector has been analysed in detail with respect to possible real-time cloud services, which can be incorporated into the respective area. Consequently, existing cloud services, current trends, limitations and future scopes have been discussed followed by recommendations in each section. For example, for IoT based application in power and energy sector, contribution includes finding the limitations of cloud service have been found such as unoptimised communication scheme, data complexity, interoperability, cyber security risk and data integrity issue. To address these limitations respectively, a policy to ensure backward and horizontal compatibility, proposal to increase local processing, data compression and prediction, implementation of big data techniques, authentication and encryption, planning and redundancy have been included as recommendation. For other four categories, an intense analysis has been carried out in similar fashion. Finally, the recommendation has been added for each category for the next barrier scope of research.",

  "abstract": "The fourth industrial revolution aims to transform industrial units into more efficient and productive organisations, through the implementation of technologies based on digital and intelligent systems. This research assesses the level of implementation of the 'Industry 4.0' concept in Portugal, identifying its benefits and difficulties, and also seeking to identify the best tool to assess the level of I4.0. To this end, a qualitative approach was used, supported by 18 interviews with industrial managers. The research shows that there is no integrated view of the I4.0 concept, although the results demonstrate a concern of companies with the subject, with actions aiming to implement the concept in their organisations, where the main barriers are found at the level of investment needed and change management. As to the benefits, it is highlighted the increases in productivity and the reduction of errors in the process.",

  "abstract": "The governmental sector is suffering from the lack of reliance on technology resources, in complex financial processes, like the budget process which is still prepared using the traditional way, which is paper-based, has a lack of technical aspect, and consumes time so unreal budget estimation has resulted. On the other hand, semantic web technology proved itself and achieved great success in many domains. Ontology is considered the backbone of the semantic web and is defined as a shared understanding of a domain that could help to store, retrieve, share, and reuse knowledge of a domain in an effective way. In this paper, ontology is used for the first time to build a budget ontological model to represent the public budget structure for the Egyptian public sector domain and make budget knowledge more accessible and usable, in order to enhance the integrity, transparency, reliability, and accuracy of the governmental public budget.",

  "abstract": "Digital transformation (DT) has presented tremendous opportunities and challenges to organisations. By leveraging continuously emerging digital technologies, organisations are increasingly pursuing to make their business models efficient and smart. Consequently, research on DT has gained significant momentum in academia and practice. Although many studies present insights about DT as a phenomenon, the underlying factors encouraging such transformations are not frequently evaluated and discussed, and less so in Indian context. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a multiple case study of six organisations engaged in DT and identifying primary reasons driving the organisations towards DT. These factors are broadly classified into four categories - business innovation and process improvement, business sustainability, internal digital aspirations, and unplanned external exigencies. The study empirically identifies the drivers of DT that beginner organisations can use to address 'where to start for DT'. The well-established organisations can use these drivers as a baseline to assess, contextualise and strategise their DT efforts to improve the success rates of their DT endeavours.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this research is to identify and model critical barriers to Industry 4.0 technology practices as a tool for sustainable supply chain in Egyptian enterprises. The opinions and perceptions of 159 enterprises' managers were surveyed, in which 18 critical barriers were identified using the questionnaire. By applying the ISM tool, the ranks and the degree of influence of each barrier for each technique of industry were achieved. It was observed that cost and lack of financial resources and fund programs always comes in the first rank, which means it is the most influencing barrier among all other barriers. The main implication of this research is providing a roadmap to decision-makers to facilitate Industry 4.0 implementation in a number of ways in Egyptian SMEs in various sectors.",

  "abstract": "This research paper valuates the factors of continuance intention and intention to recommend application-based mobile payment systems. The research model has been developed based on several strands of theories in information systems. The model has been tested using 360 respondents' data collected from Wuhan, PR China. This study used a hybrid method by relating structural equation modelling (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for analysing data. The SEM confirms that satisfaction, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, habit, and context are the key predictors of the continuance intention. The continuance intention positively affects the intention to recommend the application-based mobile payment. This study also confirms the moderating effect of context on the relationship between satisfaction and continuance intention. The ANN concludes that the most significant predictor of continuance intention is satisfaction, while the least important factor is habit. This study's implications provide worthy insights to the researchers, practitioners, and managers, which assist them in devising effective strategies for implementing application-based mobile payment.",

It presents the techniques employed for managing and modelling supply chain risk drivers in an encapsulated form to aid the risk related decision making in industries. This review paper proposes a hybrid of systematic and descriptive review approach. Initially, the authors apply a systematic literature review approach to study the current research directions and subthemes in SCRM. The information thus obtained is also utilised to shortlist the research papers for the descriptive review that identifies the various models and methods applied in SCRM research. A software tool known as BibExcel is employed for data mining and analysing. Another software tool called Pajek is used to visualise the BibExcel outputs. Furthermore, this review paper identifies and discusses the significant gaps in SCRM research studies and proposes some unique and promising areas for future research.",

  "abstract": "This study sought to understand experts' perceptions regarding sustainable innovations in marketing in the fast food sector in Brazil. As a research method, it used in-depth interviews and convenience sampling, with eight interviewees, including researchers, managers, and consultants with at least 10 years of experience in the fast food sector. By analysing the content of the interviews (using the 13 pre-existing categories from the literature review, plus two new categories that emerged), it was noted that the interviewees found it difficult to identify the concept of sustainability. In addition, the Brazilian context appears to be an obstacle for the adoption of more sustainable consumption habits by the population in general, due to an educational gap. The interviewees indicated the need to develop public policies for the country to enable the implementation of sustainable innovations. There is little evidence of specific sustainable innovations in the fast food sector in Brazil.",

  "abstract": "Collaborative body sensor network (CBSN) is formed of several body sensor networks (BSNs) moving in a given area and able to exchange data between each other. One of the challenges in CBSN is to design a Medium Access Protocol that efficiently supports nodes mobility, and at the same time, guarantees immediate delivery of urgent data, and maintains high energy efficiency during regular observation. In this paper, a hybrid traffic and mobility aware MAC (TMA-MAC) is proposed to satisfy CBSN's traffic requirements through adopting a hybrid DS-CDMA/DTDMA technique, and to support CBSN's nodes mobility through ensuring efficient transmission of intracluster mobile nodes data and proposing a mechanism to handle inter-cluster nodes joining requests. TMA-MAC was compared to other existing protocols under both traffic and mobility variations. Simulations were conducted using OPNET to evaluate TMA-MAC with respect to packet delay, packet drop percentage, and energy consumption.",

  "abstract": "This research aims to study the drivers of agricultural value chains from an emerging market perspective by using total interpretive structure modelling (TISM) and then further empirically validate the framework. To achieve the study objective, in addition to an extensive literature review and expert views, primary data has been collected from 106 farmers to clarify the drivers of the agriculture value chain. Based on the review and the elements of the work system theory, we confirmed the drivers as: technology adoption, capacity building, diversified business, top management commitment, infrastructure and logistics, awareness and knowledge about demand and supply uncertainty, customer focus, competitive advantage, supplier relation management, and waste management process. The study's key findings focus on the predictive value of significant drivers for a sustainable agriculture value chain. These drivers have an integrated and transitive link with each other which may be helpful for the firms in developing a strategic road map for sustaining the agriculture value chain. The model and its predictive value may help the firms to construct a strategy to integrate the drivers.",

  "abstract": "In the last decade, students facing a PhD course in Europe find terrible difficulties in reaching a permanent position in the academy. The situation gets worse when graduated PhDs have to migrate to public/private organisations that are not always ready to understand and improve the research experience. In such a situation, one of the most critical aspects is encountered immediately in the recruitment phase, since the keywords used in job offers portals are based on the employers' vocabulary and usually do not match the words that a researcher would use to describe her/his experience. Therefore, it is widely recognised that there is a need to define a system that can support a recruiters team in recruiting PhDs. The approach presented in this paper aims at designing a decision support tool able to guide the choices of recruiter of any company in the evaluation of profiles of candidates with PhD.",

  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the linkages among productivity, information technology (IT) capital block, skills and key plant variables of 32 Indian industries for the period of 2009-2015. The author first reviews the key studies focused on productivity, IT capital block, skills and key plant variables and provide key findings. Next, to explain data variation over time, the author employs inductive research techniques, kernel density estimators and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test) and compares the outcomes with contemporary growth and development literature. To control the data panel from missing values and possible selection biases, the study employs appropriate econometric techniques. The results indicate that level of IT capital influences the output growth of Indian industries so does the level of skilled labours. Moreover, firms with positive IT capital accumulation result in better debt and liability management. The outcomes also suggest that IT investment of Indian industries is sensitive to the location of plant and type of ownership. However, the author fails to find any impact of gender diversity and contractual labour on output growth. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study that employs descriptive statistical techniques to analyse the nexus among productivity growth, IT capital block, skills and organisation factors by using Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data which were used by handful studies in the context of India.",

  "abstract": "Retailers' foremost objective is to ensure right product at right place at right price for the right customer, which predominantly hinges on its competencies to maximise On-Shelf-Availability (OSA). Although many studies are undertaken to identify and resolve root causes for diminished OSA, they always have centred around supply side inventory and replenishment. In this article we ventured out to explore OSA from a sell side perspective and discovered unidentified diminished OSA occurrence. Accordingly, systematic approach to identify and then estimate the value of diminished sales due to diminished OSA is proposed by means of modern data science mechanisms. Furthermore, a new nomenclature 'invisible missing data' is proposed by drawing a parallel to (1) Out-Of-Stock (OOS) as missing data and (2) estimation of OOS impact on sales as a missing value imputation problem. Finally, the solution made lucid enough to cater to a wider audience and encourage further future refinements in this field.",

  "abstract": "Software development deals with larger design and development pressures and requires software system to be developed in a shorter period. A big problem encountered during software development is the inability to find and retrieve the required reusable components. One of the reasons behind this issue is the scarcity of sophisticated techniques and query methods. The primary challenge of effective component retrieval is to bridge the semantic gap between natural language and component description. In this paper, we proposed an approach that offers automatic retrieval of components by employing domain ontologies. It allows users to enter the query in natural language, and a semantic service format is used to treat software components as services. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can retrieve components for a given query accurately and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. This work also explores statistics for evaluating software components and finally discusses open challenges and future directions.",

The aim of the study is to reflect the current status of serialisation implementation in the pharmaceutical industry, discover interests and expectations and explore the post implementation environment. A stakeholder analysis was conducted to assess the importance of each stakeholder. Furthermore, to discover interests and expectations, analyse the status and explore what is coming next when serialisation will be effective, personal in-depth interviews with subject material experts took place. Our results indicate that manufacturers, CMOs and re-packagers are most impacted, and serialisation is a necessity for regulation compliance. Its implementation aims to bring important changes, the impacts are gradually visible and the journey until it is fully implemented will last for some years to come.",

It does so by using data on youth respondents from five Middle Eastern countries, extracted from the 2018 wave of the Program for International Students' Assessment (PISA) survey. The findings reveal that except for the UAE and Qatar, respondents from the remaining three countries report below OECD level average access to ICT resources. The within region comparative analysis also highlights significant cross-country heterogeneity in ICT resource access at home. Moreover, controlling for not only cross-country spatial correlations, and factors such as: home educational resources, parental occupation status, economic and socio-cultural status, age, gender, and grade level in school; each standard deviation increase in access to ICT resources is found to raise youths' subjective well-being by 1.88% standard deviations. Hence, pointing out the value of ICT resources diffusion on welfare improvement in the region.",

We used Kassen's (2013) local level framework as a base but adopt it to Europe, expand and elaborate Kassen's discussion of local open data initiatives using the Stockholm open data platform. The Stockholm open data project is evaluated from three perspectives: legal, political and economic environments. Open data activities are further evaluated in terms of the main features of open data defined by the Open Knowledge Foundation (2015) including: availability and access, reuse and redistribution, and universal participation. The impact of opening the data is evaluated against the three common reasons described by Open Knowledge (2015): transparency, releasing social and commercial value, and participation and engagement. We found that projects promoting open data initiatives, are more similar to 'closed' platforms that provides APIs.",

  "abstract": "Proxy re-encryption is used to delegate the task of providing access control to the outsourced data on a cloud storage server. However, the straightforward application of proxy re-encryption requires the cloud storage server to be trusted. The cloud storage servers are however, often, honest-but-curious or untrusted. Towards solving the problem of access control enforcement delegation of outsourced data, we design a quorum controlled proxy re-encryption scheme. We show that, using the proposed scheme, task of enforcing access control is delegated to a set of proxies, such that a quorum of proxies should come together to enforce access control. By distributing trust among multiple proxies, single point of trust is eliminated, and the system is made fault tolerant. We prove the IND-CPA security of the proposed scheme under the DBDHI assumption and show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties of a proxy re-encryption scheme thus outperforming the existing schemes.",

  "abstract": "Abundance of data makes privacy more vulnerable than ever as it increases the attackers' ability to infer confidential data from multiple data sources. Anonymisation protects data privacy by ensuring that critical data are non-unique to any individual so that we can conceal the individual's identity. Existing techniques aim to minimally alter the original data so that either the anonymised data or its analytical results (e.g., classification) will not disclose certain privacy. Our research aims both. This paper presents HeuristicMin, an anonymisation approach that applies generalisations to satisfy user-specified anonymity requirements while maximising data retention (for analysis purposes). Unlike others, by exploiting monotonicity property of generalisation and simple heuristics for pruning, HeuristicMin provides an efficient exhaustive search for optimal generalised data. The paper articulates different meanings of optimality in anonymisation and compares HeuristicMin with well-known approaches analytically and empirically. HeuristicMin produces competitive results on the classification obtained from the anonymised data.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to design and develop a framework for designing a metacognitive-supported augmented reality application for teaching and learning basic pneumatic systems. This multi-method study with the fuzzy delphi method (FDM) and interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach involved 12 experts in multidisciplinary fields. The data was collected using seven Likert-type scale questionnaires. The design phase of the framework using the FDM found that the expert consensus for all principal components and the elements is greater than 75% with the threshold value, d ≤ 0.2. In contrast, the development phase of the framework was performed based on experts' voting using the ISM approach. The Concept Star software was used to develop the sequence of the elements based on their priority from every principal component to produce the MetAR design framework.",

  "abstract": "The 3D printing industry has been recently affected by two events: the fact that open source (OS) business models are getting momentum, and the widespread diffusion of the Maker Movement. We argue that 3D printers can be conceptualised as innovations which embody both technological and symbolic aspects. If innovations of the first type are solely adopted for their technical utility, innovations which have also symbolic connotation may confer a new social meaning to an item. By analysing an international sample of 3D printer users, we highlight that adoption of 3D proprietary printers are driven by technologically-rooted considerations, while adherence to the Maker Movement is a key factor behind the adoption of 3D OS printers.",

  "abstract": "In Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), the large number of providers and instances combined with the lack of transparency in understanding pricing policies hampers the choice for the best provider-plan-instance combination. An issue less explored by the scientific community is the physical location of datacentre and its influence on forming the final price of an instance. We developed a set of four mathematical models that estimates and represents in detail the prices of each of the three leading providers in the market and the canonical model. The modelling was empirically carried out. The verification and analysis of the individual models, and of the canonical model, were carried out through the comparison of the real-price and the price estimated by the model. Thanks to that, it was possible to see that the values obtained represented characteristics from computational resources in the composition of the provider plans.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to understand what factors influence companies to customise products international customers and markets. A qualitative case study with semi-structured interviews was conducted at one multinational corporation to gain insights into its product customisation strategy. The findings demonstrate how internationalisation can impact product customisation and identify four factors in the customisation process: culture, internationalisation, knowledge transfer, and product strategy. Tailored marketing strategies that influenced the international product customisation strategy (IPCS) were used. This study augmented on our understanding of how product customisation impacts internationalisation and vice versa, revealing the importance of knowledge transfer in IPCS and its growing impact due to digitalisation. It also shows how both B2B marketing and a tailored marketing strategy are overarching themes in international product customisation, making it one of few studies to recognise the relevance of omnichannel strategy in the B2B market segment.",

  "abstract": "The vast majority of what has been written about the monetary system and its theories was developed when money was totally or partially backed by some type of merchandise. At present, commodity money no longer exists, only debt money. This paper addresses money from its transition to the current situation, through this 'manifesto of money', for the construction of a new theoretical framework that adapts to the current reality and adopting money as a real medium of exchange. This paper uses the methodology of historical review and of existing power relations in this historical moment in time called the archaeological and genealogical methodology by Foucault. Using this tool, a review of the related economic literature is made and the incongruities of the current monetary system are described. The central axis of this work is the 'neutrality of money' which is used to develop a proposal for a national currency and a proposal for an international exchange currency as the basis for the construction of a new model.",

  "abstract": "Extended reality (XR) has revamped the way people experience the physical and the virtual environments, from observation to immersion. XR is an umbrella term that encompasses both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), among others. Despite the promising outlook, this nascent technology has been shrouded by uncertain possibilities, making the adoption of XR technology much slower than expected. Moreover, the interdisciplinary applications of XR technology have led to scattered scholarly works and fragmentary insights to be translated into practice. Thus, there is a pressing need for a critical review and synthesis of prior XR research in order to strengthen this emerging field in IS. To accomplish this, the current study identifies and analyses a total of 45 articles through an extensive literature search. As a result, this study identifies the major drivers, barriers, and boundary conditions to XR adoption, classifies and map them into a holistic conceptual model.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Technology Management",
  "abstract": "The ongoing developments in information technology have resulted in new technologies as a replacement for those already existing. This has led to users resorting to these new technologies, often in parallel to the existing offerings. These users then later decide whether to switch to the new technologies fully, a phenomenon referred to as the 'technology transition'. In this paper, drawing on theories on social psychology, we present a theoretical model for explaining technology transition from an individual's perspective in two geographies (Germany and India). Based on survey responses in the two geographies, we validate the model and demonstrate the country-specific factors influencing an individual's intention to transition to a tablet computer from a conventional computing device. The investigation of technology transition at the individual level is also a contribution to the cross-cultural stream of research and provides a basis for further inquiry in this field.",

  "journal_name": "International Journal of Corporate Governance",
  "abstract": "We develop a conceptual, game theoretic model to analyse say-on-pay and understand whether it benefits shareholders. We analyse the traditional delegated-governance structure wherein shareholders delegate CEO compensation decision to the board. The board has an informational advantage and can collude with management for private benefits. We contrast this with an alternate governance structure referred to as owner-governance where shareholders determine compensation. Firm performance is dependent on CEO effort and stochastic factors. There are clear insights for policy. First, contrary to popular sentiment, say-on-pay does not improve shareholder welfare. Second, incentives for the CEO decrease shareholder welfare for the most part, because luck is a major factor. Third, shareholders are better off trading say-on-pay for the right to fire board members by dismantling board entrenchment, enabled by widely adopted staggered boards and poison pills. Entrenchment makes it prohibitively costly to remove and replace boards or a majority of board members.",

  "abstract": "This paper is derived from the research project of cleansing customer address data for the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), which is the largest electric utility company in the world and was ranked the 2nd in the 2016 Fortune Global 500. Address standardisation involves development of a standard address format for data integration, de-duplication, auto address correction/completion, and is widely considered as a very challenging data cleansing task. Address standardisation is critical for routine business tasks, customer relationship management, business intelligence for customer-oriented cooperates, and others. Address standardisation is particularly difficult for the Chinese language. The underlying reasons include: 1) the current address standard placed in China is only realised at the city/town level; 2) due to a number of reasons, many hand-written addresses are incomplete or contain errors; 3) it is difficult to process the Chinese language in a machine fashion due to the language. characteristics. To tackle challenges, we propose a hybrid approach combining both statistical and rule-based methods, which are the two mainstream address standardisation approaches. Our hybrid approach utilises the merits of the both methods and can complete the address standardisation task with a little human efforts and computational time, while achieving high accuracy.",

GIs can be used as an investment incentive within public-private partnerships. Awareness-raising is linked to explaining/understanding the GI system's status quo of international law construct, under the European Union, United Nations and the World Bank Group frameworks. Consequentially, interest is sourced from the academic, private, public and not-for-profit sectors, principally professionals with social, economic, legal and environmental backgrounds. The provision of reference material is valuable for readers to fully grasp the GI link to sustainable development. It applies international relations \"constructivism\" within trade, international cooperation and intellectual property. It provides substantial evidence on policies and actions integrating the GI framework to accelerate UN SDGs. The analysis sets the ground for developing a coherent GI monitoring and evaluation system globally.",
