  "title": "Timing of blockchain adoption in a supply chain with competing manufacturers",
  "abstract": "Recent improvements in consumers' awareness of product traceability have revealed the disadvantages of traditional supply chain traceability systems. Traditional traceability systems are centralized, and the data that they use are vulnerable to tampering, resulting in a low level of consumer trust. Blockchain technology, as a distributed ledger, can solve these problems. In this study, we examine the blockchain technology introduction decisions of a supply chain involving two competing manufacturers and a single retailer, and their effects on supply chain performance. We find that manufacturers should adopt blockchain technology only when consumer sensitivity to blockchain technology exceeds a certain level and manufacturers who can introduce blockchain technology first are more likely to reap big gains in profits. Regarding the unit verification fee that the retailer pays to the manufacturer when introducing blockchain technology, the manufacturer subsidizes this fee to the retailer in the form of lower wholesale prices. In other words, there is no additional wholesale cost to the retailer for blockchain technology-based products. The results of this study provide guidance for supply chain members’ market practices.",

  "title": "Sustainable development of green reverse logistics based on blockchain",
  "abstract": "With the continuous convenience of life, logistics has become an indispensable existence in life. Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a “double chain” structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.",

  "title": "HBFL: A hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework for collaborative IoT intrusion detection",
  "abstract": "The continuous strengthening of the security posture of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems is vital due to the increasing number of interconnected devices and the volume of sensitive data shared. Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model’s detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.",

  "title": "RZee: Cryptographic and statistical model for adversary detection and filtration to preserve blockchain privacy",
  "abstract": "Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization’s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.",

  "abstract": "Digital collection and maintenance of evidence corresponding to an accident is of utmost relevance as vehicles become connected and part of Internet of things ecosystem. A conceptual evidence management framework is proposed examining the future of accident investigation forensics in the era of connected vehicles. The framework discusses how evidence generated from vehicles involved in incident along with supporting evidence from nearby vehicles CCTVs and road users can be collected and managed over blockchain using smart contracts in a vehicle to everything connected environment. The management of evidence over blockchain serves as an immutable and auditable means to investigate and settle cases post an accident among the stakeholders. Dynamic access control over evidence data and reports based on location of incident and vehicle involved is implemented with the help of smart contracts. The cost of deploying and carrying out transactions using the smart contracts is evaluated over both public and private Ethereum blockchain. Mechanism and cost involved in storing evidence on chain versus off chain using Inter Planetary File System in most optimised manner saving memory and execution cost is compared and presented. The smart contract codes are deployed on Rinkeby test network and can be accessed using address mentioned.",

  "title": "Security and QoS issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: A tutorial",
  "abstract": "The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-μs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.",

  "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in the blockchain technology, and many blockchain-based applications have been developed to take advantage of its decentralization, transparency, fault tolerance, and strong security. In the field of smart grids, a plethora of proposals have emerged to utilize blockchain for augmenting intelligent energy management, energy trading, security and privacy protection, microgrid management, and energy vehicles. Compared with traditional centralized approaches, blockchain-based solutions are able to exploit the advantages of blockchain to realize better functionality in smart grids. However, the blockchain technology itself has its disadvantages in low processing throughput and weak privacy protection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to study how to integrate blockchain with smart grids in a more effective way so that the advantages of blockchain can be maximized and its disadvantages can be avoided.",

  "abstract": "The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile gives users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.",

  "title": "An advanced and secure framework for conducting online examination using blockchain method",
  "abstract": "Nowadays, the online platform has been used by many educational institutions, to conduct tests, especially for secondary to tertiary level students. The most popular online test program is run by providing a user id and password to the candidates, and subsequently, they log in to the given web page to answer the questions. However, this system has a lot of bugs, the password can be misused followed by cheating in the test. This shows the importance of a secure system being implemented to avoid such a problem. This paper presents a blockchain framework that secures the online examination system. The proposed framework has been used to secure a data management system that connects to existing educational data. Institutions can simply compile their data history without requiring a copy from the central servers. The proposed blockchain framework improves data security and removes any potential cheating between users or third-party institutions that access applications and services. In this regard, this study provides a secured framework for conducting and evaluating subject tests to ensure consistency between student and server, and secure delivery of questionnaire from the server.",

  "title": "Research on identity authentication system of Internet of Things based on blockchain technology",
  "abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications, a large amount of data is generated regularly. If this information is used by malicious attackers, it will be a great disaster for the relevant users. In this regard, this article focuses on the user’s identity privacy issues involved in the IoT. By protecting the user’s identity privacy, the attacker cannot associate the obtained data with the user’s real identity, and so achieve the purpose of protecting the user. This article uses the features of blockchain that cannot be tampered with nor forged to strengthen the reliability of the system. The proposed scheme saves the transaction information of user information through the Hyperledger and uses the ring signature method to obscure the real identity. A key generator is used to generate system public parameters and ring membership information required for signature. Users can use this information to hide their identity in a ring group of n users so that other users can only guess the true identity of the user with a probability of 1/n. Additionally, the method of aggregated signature is used to shorten the time and space required for k signature verification to 1/k, which greatly improves the efficiency. Finally, this article also uses an accountability mechanism to punish some attackers who attempt to waste system resources by revealing the real identity of the attacker and refusing to serve him. In this paper, GO language is used to write chain code to realize the proposed algorithm, and a prototype system is built through HyperLeger Fabric blockchain network, and the prototype system is verified by experiment. The correctness and efficiency of the above scheme are also proved through theoretical analysis and experiments.",

  "abstract": "In view of the problem of privacy leakage caused by the centralized location privacy protection method in mobile crowd sensing, a privacy protection method based on blockchain smart contract was proposed. Firstly, the trusted distributed environment blockchain is adopted to replace the third-party server. In order to avoid the leakage of personal information, users register an anonymous identity on the blockchain. In addition, in order to solve the problem of user’s location privacy leakage caused by mutual deceiving behavior among users in distributed structure, a dummy location algorithm based on two-attribute decision is designed on smart contract. In this algorithm, the distance between each location and the user location and the historical query probability of each location are obtained by calculating the peripheral location. Then, different thresholds are set for each location and a cyclic filtering is carried out. As a result, an anonymous set is obtained that effectively protects the user’s location. Finally, the simulation experiment proves that the method can not only improve the efficiency of protecting user’s location privacy, but also has lower time and computation overhead.",

  "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a distributed sensor network composed a large number of nodes with low cost, low performance and self-management. The special structure of WSN brings both convenience and vulnerability. For example, a malicious participant can launch attacks by capturing a physical device. Therefore, node authentication that can resist malicious attacks is very important to network security. Recently, blockchain technology has shown the potential to enhance the security of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-empowered Authentication Scheme (BAS) for WSN. In our scheme, all nodes are managed by utilizing the identity information stored on the blockchain. Besides, the simulation experiment about worm detection is executed on BAS, and the security is evaluated from detection and infection rate. The experiment results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively inhibit the spread and infection of worms in the network.",

To avoid a single point of failure and ensure data integrity, blockchain technology was widely applied. However, due to the demand for computing power and resources, IoT devices with limited capabilities and resources are unsuitable for crowdsensing implementation in the blockchain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based crowdsensing model named\nwith a novel consensus mechanism based on global reputation to resolve the issues raised above.

  "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a potential computing paradigm that exploits collective human intelligence to solve complex tasks, but it suffers from various safety and security problems. Blockchain has emerged as a promising technology to address most of the security issues, however, it is challenging to find an appropriate and trusted blockchain-based consensus protocol for crowdsourcing services. This work proposes a novel Trust-based Blockchain Crowdsourcing consensus protocol that selects a leader and validators based on various trust factors. The proposed protocol addresses a major issue of ensuring correctness associated with the safety and security-critical systems which has a vital importance because failure of such systems may lead to adverse consequences. Mainly it is focused on persistence and liveness properties preventing invalid block insertion and consensus delay attacks. Model checking technique is utilized because of its effectiveness and automatic nature to perform formal verification. The proposed protocol is specified using Communicating Sequential Programs, and the persistence and liveness properties are specified through Linear Temporal Logic. The model verification is performed by giving the formal model and the properties as input to the Process Analysis Toolkit which checks for the satisfaction or violation of the properties.",

  "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for energy-aware task offloading in join SDN-Blockchain 5G massive IoT edge network",
  "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge allows cloud computing services for topology and location-sensitive distributed computing. As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor–Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading. The latter is in symbiosis with Proof-of-Authority Blockchain consensus to validate IoT transactions and blocks. By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically. Carried out experiments put forth that our approach offers 50% better energy efficiency, which outperforms traditional consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work and PBFT, in terms of throughput and network latency and offers better scheduling performance.",

  "abstract": "Applications of blockchain technology (BCT) are scaling globally, especially in developing countries, where the opportunities that they exploit are often most prevalent. Achieving scale is vital for BCT ventures, which rely on network effects. BCT ventures seeking to scale employ innovative methods for scaling and also provide interesting insights on entrepreneurial scaling. We draw attention to three approaches that support scaling – promoting technology platforms, leveraging collective action, and navigating institutional contexts– and identify theoretically-grounded strategies for scaling related to these three approaches. We also build from the practical experience of cLabs, a BCT venture seeking to scale Celo, a mobile-first cryptocurrency blockchain platform focused on the developing world. We examine what BCT proponents like cLabs need to do to scale quickly and synthesize key insights, strategies for BCT ventures in developing contexts, and opportunities for future research.",

  "title": "The design of power grid data management system based on blockchain technology and construction of system security evaluation model",
  "abstract": "The construction of smart grid has triggered comprehensive changes in power equipment. At the same time, massive data are waiting to be screened, analyzed and processed. However, there are many data sources and complex data structure in smart grid, and smart grid requires higher security, reliability, traceability, non-repudiation and real-time performance of data processing, which poses unprecedented challenges to the traditional data management. Blockchain technology has the advantages of decentralization, autonomy, leakage prevention and openness. It can match the demands of power data management in terms of operation mode, security protection, complement power data, and better meet the security and credibility requirements of energy Internet. Therefore, this paper designs the smart grid data management system based on blockchain, and constructs the system security evaluation model by using AHP and expert consultation method. Firstly, the characteristics of smart grid big data and blockchain technology are analyzed; Then the technical architecture of data management system is designed by using alliance chain, and the technical architecture is analyzed in detail; Finally, the index factors affecting system security are combed, and the system security evaluation model is constructed by AHP. Distributed storage, asymmetric encryption, consensus mechanism, and other technologies of blockchain technology can well solve the problems of power grid data storage and application, and better ensure the security of smart grid data.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is being used in various global supply chains with its ever-increasing maturity and popularity. However, in the presence of subjective information that does not have a digital footprint, blockchain application is a grey area. This is due to the difficulty in confirming the authenticity or legitimacy of information before achieving consensus on it using existing mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Stake (PoS). In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we propose the Proof by Earnestness (PoE) consensus mechanism that determines the subjective information’s truthfulness before further processing and formalising in blockchains. We consider supply chain risk management (SCRM) as our application area due to the vast amount of available subjective information.",

  "abstract": "The healthcare business can benefit from the Internet of Things (IoT) in terms of data management and transfer. Patient health data can be acquired locally from devices that can be used to make real-time decisions based on the data. For many years, several hospitals have deployed IoT in their patient rooms and their body parts. IoT devices could be vulnerable to hacking due to a lack of authentication and encryption policies, posing serious hazards to consumers. As a result, blockchain is useful for securing and proving transactions in the IoT. As a result, it is proposed that the problem be solved using Fog Computing (FGC), Edge Computing, and blockchain. Based on FGC technology, models of analysis, and a signature-encryption algorithm (SE), a three-tiered architecture is employed for the identification, verification, and identification of healthcare IoT devices. The generated findings are used to assess the suggested innovative SE algorithm. We discovered that FGC-based blockchain performed better for detecting malicious nodes in terms of packet error rate, reliability, and throughput when compared to cloud settings and other environments.",

  "abstract": "In consideration of the inconvenience of sharing user identity authorization, and the lack of correctness verification for searching electronic medical records in hospitals under the many-to-many search model, we propose an blockchain-aided searchable attribute-based encryption scheme that supports verification, we apply the scheme to electronic health record systems. Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users’ privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based mobile crowdsourcing model with task security and task assignment",
  "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a task assignment technology that has emerged in recent years, enabling companies to reduce costs and increase work efficiency. Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.",

  "abstract": "The concept of a smart city has been introduced to address the shortfalls of urbanization. The aid of technologies in smart cities is envisioned to be the key initiative to mitigate these challenges. However, the technologies exposure imposes challenging issues for the traditional centralized data dissemination schemes in smart cities. Consequently, smart city is undergoing a transition to a decentralized system through the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper presents an extensive survey of blockchain applicability for data dissemination in smart cities. We focus on the components of smart: transportation, healthcare, education, energy and building in smart cities and analyze state-of-the-art work on the integration of these components with blockchain. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of existing literature and evaluate the performance efficiency and the extent of security and privacy achieved. The analysis leads to our new design of a secure smart city data dissemination framework using blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive abstraction in the literature that can be utilized for the designation of future blockchain-smart cities data dissemination schemes with the inclusion of participating entities. Finally, we present open research issues and challenges and discuss future research directions.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based COVID vaccination registration and monitoring",
  "abstract": "COVID-19 has changed almost all aspects of our lives. Governments around the world have imposed lockdowns to slow down the transmissions. Fortunately, we have found the vaccine, in fact, a good number of them. However, managing the testing and vaccination process of the total population is a mammoth job. However, there are always delays or data silo problems in multi-organizational work. Therefore, streamlining this process is vital to improve efficiency and save more lives. Because of its effective data sharing mechanism among different entities with a number of security features, blockchain can be an effective tool for different applications in the health sector. Furthermore, blockchain provides a distributed system along with greater privacy, transparency, and authenticity. In this article, we have presented a blockchain-based system that seamlessly integrates testing and vaccination systems, allowing the system to be transparent. The instant verification of any tamper-proof COVID-19 test result has been developed, which will serve as “Test Certificates”. A transparent and efficient vaccination system has also been exhibited and implemented as the “Digital Vaccine Passport” (DVP) system. The infection rate-based prioritization will ensure a transparent and fair vaccination process as well as tackle the distribution issue of the limited amount of vaccine. The comparative review with other existing works is also discussed, highlighting a clear difference from the existing works. Our proposed system is distinctive on the basis of prioritization of vaccines and seamless integration of test certificates and vaccine passports, which will aid in controlling the pandemic situation. This system will also be handy in the case of tackling any future pandemics initially.",

  "abstract": "Applying blockchain technology to the Internet of Things (IoT) provides several advantages when compared to conventional systems, including improving the security by ensuring data integrity and accountability while enabling reliable control over many devices. However, integrating blockchain into IoT systems presents some challenges. A main challenges is designing a consensus protocol that is suitable for the IoT systems, where some devices may lack adequate resources, such as computation power. This paper introduces a novel consensus protocol called honesty-based distributed proof of authority (HDPoA) via scalable work. HDPoA is based on proof of authority (PoA) and proof of work (PoW), with the integration of PoW, HDPoA is able to realize the security advantages provided by PoW. This is achieved by utilizing the IoT devices’ collective computation power to mine and generate a new block.",

  "title": "A Novel Secured Multi-Access Edge Computing based VANET with Neuro fuzzy systems based Blockchain Framework",
  "abstract": "In vehicle ad-hoc networks, the progression of wireless communication technology to 6G, overcomes storage, processing, privacy, and power limits to create an efficient and intelligent next generation transportation system. Vehicular ad hoc network may now offer remarkable availability, reliability, and throughput using 6G technology. However, the VANET system’s data should be protected. This paper proposes an effective batch authentication and key exchange technique to avoid contact with hostile vehicle users. Moreover, three types of systems are proposed: PKI, ID-based, and MAC-based. The neuro-fuzzy inference technique was used to predict VANET security ratings. The Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain model is used to secure data transit. Additionally, this research examined the work from a blockchain perspective combined with MEC. There are 3 level to comprise the architecture: perception, edge computing, and services. Throughout the blockchain transmission process, the first layer make certain the security of VANET data. The perception layer makes use of edge computing and cloud services on the edge. The service layer protects data by using both traditional cloud storage and blockchain technology. The lowest layer of the system architecture is dedicated to the throughput and quality of service requirements of MEC users. The primary challenge is achieving consensus across blockchain nodes while maintaining the MEC system’s and blockchain’s performance. To simulate the joint optimization problem, a Markov decision process with reward function is utilized. The simulation results are conferred to illustrate the validity of study assertions.",

  "title": "Blockchain for IoT access control: Recent trends and future research directions",
  "abstract": "With the rapid development of wireless sensor networks, smart devices, and traditional information and communication technologies, there is tremendous growth in the use of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services in our everyday life. IoT systems deal with high volumes of data. This data can be particularly sensitive, as it may include health, financial, location, and other personal information. Therefore, fine-grained security management in IoT demands effective access control. Several proposals discuss access control for the IoT. However, a limited focus is given to the emerging blockchain-based solutions for IoT access control. In this paper, we review the recent trends and critical needs for blockchain-based solutions for IoT access control. We identify several important aspects of blockchain, including decentralised control, secure storage and sharing information in a trustless manner for IoT access control, including their benefits and limitations. Finally, we note some future research directions on converging blockchain in IoT access control efficiently and effectively.",

  "title": "A blockchain-adaptive contractual approach for multi-contracting organizational entities",
  "abstract": "Every organization relies on a designed contract to manage the rules that guide and coordinate the activities within each organization. However, traditional and contracts have many challenges. This has created the need for automated digital contracts, which are largely used within organizations. Although these contracts provide their own sets of advantages, they still have a single point of failure and still rely on trusted parties that cannot enforce rules. This has caused the introduction of blockchain smart contracts to help organizations collaborate in a decentralized manner. However, most contracting approaches are still influenced by traditional contracting schemes and cannot leverage the blockchain’s features. This has made contracts designed over the blockchain network inefficient and difficult to manage. Existing contractual approaches also do not account for the full advantages of blockchain smart contracts due to a lack of focus in this area. The blockchain and its contracting mechanism are unique, and thus, a unique perspective must be brought in designing a contracting scheme that works efficiently with the blockchain and its inherent smart contracts. In this work, we develop a unique contractual approach that is adaptive to the blockchain and leverages its features in ensuring an efficient contracting scheme that is able to solve the major operations within organizations. We introduce a novel concept of contracting among blockchain networks using existing contract theory concepts to understand better how participants can work together across multiple organizations. We create a novel multi-contracting scheme for multiple parties to collaborate and work together efficiently between multiple organizations, ensuring the completion of projects and contract solidification. We develop a complex interlinked system of contracts to make contacts among multiple organizations easily traceable and manageable. We enhance this with a unique contract consolidation scheme to avoid redundancy. We utilize our proposed scheme to develop a uniquely transparent and fair workflow within organizations such as recruitment and employment leveraging blockchain-based oracle nodes. We extend this work to outsourced and sub-outsourced projects on the blockchain where an arbitration scheme is developed in multi-arbitration and multi-contracting scenarios. We also consider in our case in ex-facto situations. We tested our proposed blockchain-based idea over existing blockchain networks. Our results prove the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed idea.",

The blockchain announcements have led to a significantly positive increase in the value of listed firms since blockchain technology was valued in China. We find that high-tech firms with more technological attributes and reserves could be seen as more credible and trigger more significant stock returns than non-high-tech firms. In addition, state-owned high-tech firms with normal financial status and voluntary disclosure would augment such signaling credibility. In general, the results support that corporate announcements' signaling credibility is vital for market reaction.",

  "abstract": "Currently, the global spread of COVID-19 is taking a heavy toll on the lives of the global population. There is an urgent need to improve and strengthen the coordination of vaccine supply chains in response to this severe pandemic. In this study, we consider a vaccine supply chain based on a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies and model the supply chain as a two-player dynamic game with inventory level as the dynamic equation of the system. The study focuses on the applicability and effectiveness of the two technologies in the vaccine supply chain and provides management insights. The impact of the application of the technologies on environmental performance is also considered in the model. We also examine factors such as the number of people vaccinated, positive and side effects of vaccines, vaccine decay rate, revenue-sharing/cost-sharing ratio, and commission ratio. The results are as follows: the correlation between the difficulty in obtaining certified vaccines and the profit of a vaccine manufacturer is not monotonous; the vaccine manufacturer is more sensitive to changes in the vaccine attenuation rate. The study’s major conclusions are as follows: First, the vaccine supply chain should estimate the level of consumers’ difficulty in obtaining a certified vaccine source and the magnitude of the production planning and demand forecasting error terms before adopting the two technologies. Second, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is meaningful in the vaccine supply chain when the error terms satisfy a particular interval condition.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology resolves the bottleneck of traditional centralized data storage technology. It can better facilitate the seamless operation and supervision of port cold chain logistics and can meet the massive business demand for cold chain imports and the surging demand for pandemic prevention and control. However, it is a challenging task to incentivize cold chain enterprises in the maritime industry to adopt blockchain technology and actively participate in information sharing platform. Using evolutionary game theory, through an analysis of evolutionary stability strategies, this paper explores the evolutionary path of port cold chain logistics enterprises that participate in information sharing. An incentive mechanism based on blockchain smart contract is designed to encourage cold chain logistics enterprises to actively participate in information sharing within chains. Smart contracts can continuously encourage enterprises to participate in information sharing by timely adjusting the incentive participation costs of participating enterprises.",

  "abstract": "Since the development of smart healthcare services, different solutions have been developed in the field of healthcare to increase the life expectancy of the patient by reducing the cost of healthcare. Digital Twin (DT) is considered one of the most promising technologies and a game changer in the field of healthcare. DT is generating a virtual imitation of a physical object that mimics the status of an event by changing the information in real time. In this article, a smart context-aware physical activity monitoring framework is developed by combining different advanced techniques such as IoT, DT, FoT, CoT, and Blockchain to maintain the sensitiveness of the healthcare domain. In the proposed study, the physical movements of an elder are analyzed by utilizing the sequential data processing capability of deep learning to detect irregular physical events. In addition, the proposed framework can keep the data of an individual secured by applying progressed security highlights of blockchain. The proposed solution effectively analyzed an irregular event of an individual with considerable accuracy in real time. The calculated outcomes have shown the effectiveness of DT with smart healthcare solutions that would help to develop effective medical services by bringing patients and medical care experts together. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed solution is measured with respect to irregular event recognition, model training and testing, rate of latency, and data processing cost. In this manner, a case study defines the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the smart healthcare industry.",

  "title": "A MCDM-based framework for blockchain consensus protocol selection",
  "abstract": "Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies introduced in Bitcoin, which engaged great attention from the industry and academia and determined a rapid growth of other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). In the complex architecture of a DLT system, a consensus protocol plays a key role by ensuring that all participants agree on the data integrity without any central authority. A wide range of consensus protocols have been designed with different concepts and properties (e.g., lower energy consumption, better scalability, smaller latency, higher throughput, etc.). The key requirements for consensus protocols passing from one blockchain system to another often differ significantly, and there is no one-fit-all protocol. Therefore, selecting the most suitable consensus protocol for a particular DLT system is essential, but at the same time a challenging step, as decision-makers need to make a trade-off between conflicting requirements. This paper introduces a framework for selecting the most suitable consensus protocols depending on the identified criteria, priorities, and other requirements by incorporating Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. We demonstrate its potential by identifying the preferable consensuses for the three most common types of existing blockchain systems and on an actual application for bike renting. Moreover, the collected data and tools are freely available, ensuring full replicability, reusability, and further development.",

With the development of smart home technology, huge amounts of data stored on external servers flow between different smart devices, and the integrity of these data is of great importance to the security of smart home systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based data integrity verification scheme that supports efficient dynamic operations for a smart home system. In the verification scheme, we utilize the home gateway (HG) to aggregate all the data information and design a data structure that can be efficiently and dynamically operated to store the tag information of the data, which can reduce the local storage pressure in smart home systems. Moreover, homomorphic verifiable tags are used to formulate verification strategies and record the interactions between HG, cloud service providers (CSP), and third-party auditor (TPA) on the blockchain to make the verification service traceable and useful. Then, the theoretical analysis and experiments prove that the scheme is effective and cost-acceptable in smart home systems.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) have accelerated e-commerce growth and empowered online businesses to create value even in a globally competitive environment. The goal of this study is to develop a framework for the virtual closed-loop supply chain (VCLSC) that is based on novel blockchain and IoT technologies, as well as the concepts of sustainability and circular economy. This study integrates the normal and virtual supply chains into a single framework. To maximise the total expected revenue (TER) from the VCLSC, the costs of getting raw materials and parts, transporting them with a carbon emission tax, handling, processing, and making final products, refurbishing, recycling, and virtualization are all taken into account. These include running blockchain and IoT facilities, buying RFID tags, ensuring security, and storing data in blockchain in a way that cannot be changed. The above costs are captured in a single mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. The main objective is to maximise the TER by minimising the cost of the VCLSC network. For the solution purposes, the global solver in LINGO 19 software package is used. The obtained results and performed sensitivity analysis are used to make some implications for business organisations and government administrators to create some important policies in favour of the environment, end-users, and the development of the organisation along with the nation.",

  "title": "A blockchain-based fine-grained data sharing scheme for e-healthcare system",
  "abstract": "The cloud-aided sharing of e-healthcare data has great positive significance for research. However, due to the privacy consideration, these data are usually encrypted before uploading to the cloud server which impedes data sharing between different medical institutions. Conditional proxy re-encryption (CPRE) allows the proxy to converse ciphertext, especially by specifying a condition embed in the re-encryption key to achieve fine-grained access control over the ciphertext. Unfortunately, existing CPRE schemes cannot ensure the privacy of the condition, which may contain some sensitive private information. Furthermore, a malicious proxy server may return part of the results and even false data to save its computation or bandwidth. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based condition invisible proxy re-encryption scheme for the e-healthcare system. The proposed scheme guarantees the confidentiality of the data by hiding the condition in the re-encryption key so that the proxy cannot learn anything about the condition. Moreover, the ciphertext-searching algorithm is leveraged by executing the smart contract in the blockchain which ensures the results are correct and complete. Finally, experiment results demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme in applications.",

Named Data Networking (NDN), a new network paradigm, is designed to make content distribution with ease by enabling in-network caching and built-in multicasting, which blockchain technologies can take advantage. Moreover, blockchain may contribute to extending NDN application ecosystems including decentralized applications. Therefore, it is instrumental to have a working blockchain system that runs on NDN platform to supports its research and development.",

  "abstract": "This paper explores and demonstrates the innovation potential of blockchain and smart contracts for supply chain finance (SCF) based on cross-border beef supply chains from Australia to China. Our study adopts mechanism design and design-driven activities, and specifically employs the Agents Events Data (AED) process mapping method, which is a hybrid approach that combines Business Process Redesign (BPR) and the Resources Events Assets (REA) accounting model. The AED method consists of three sequential stages: (1) map supply chain's present state or condition; (2) introduce blockchain and smart contracts to improve supply chain processes and “traditional” SCF models; and (3) evaluate the technology and innovation impact and create new models for SCF innovation. This study identified examples of how financial risks can be mitigated or reduced with blockchain and smart contracts; and, where the credit financing itself could be fundamentally transformed. Based on this analysis, the paper's contribution is twofold: First, it proposes the group buying business model as a basis of whole-of-supply-chain finance promising new areas for SCF models that can reduce financial cost and improve cash flow performance due to greater buyer-led financing certainty and the direct involvement of buy-side demand for supply-side improvements. Second, the study demonstrates the utility of the AED process mapping as a holistic framework with fine granular levels for future empirical and fieldwork and opens up new avenues for research.",

  "abstract": "Cryptocurrency blockchain data encounter a class-imbalance problem due to only a few known labels of illicit or fraudulent activities in the blockchain network. For this purpose, we seek to compare various resampling methods applied to two highly imbalanced datasets derived from the blockchain of Bitcoin and Ethereum after further dimensionality reductions, which is different from previous studies on these datasets. Firstly, we study the performance of various classical supervised learning methods to classify illicit transactions or accounts on Bitcoin or Ethereum datasets, respectively. Consequently, we apply various resampling techniques to these datasets using the best performing learning algorithm on each of these datasets. Subsequently, we study the feature importance of the given models, wherein the resampled datasets directly influenced on the explainability of the model. Our main finding is that undersampling using the edited nearest-neighbour technique has attained an accuracy of more than 99% on the given datasets by removing the noisy data points from the whole dataset. Moreover, the best-performing learning algorithms have shown superior performance after feature reduction on these datasets in comparison to their original studies. The matchless contribution lies in discussing the effect of the data resampling on feature importance which is interconnected with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques.",

  "abstract": "Immunization has become essential for prevention of infectious diseases during pandemic situations across the globe, and unsafe vaccines are seriously affecting public health and economy of countries. However, issues such as falsified or substandard and expired vaccines are still exist due to complex global supply chains and the fact that present vaccine management systems are under the control of different entities in the vaccine supply chain. Therefore, the requirement to develop the Cyber Physical ecosystem that is more resilient, responsive and having smart track and trace is urgently required. To achieve these objectives, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) based vaccine supply chain is proposed in this work. The proposed system takes advantages of blockchain database to store the generated data through interactions among stakeholders and from IoT devices in vaccine supply chain. The proposed system is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain framework through which the proposed system achieves resiliency, track and trace of vaccine circulation. The performance evaluations are obtained by testing a HLF with smart contracts. The evaluation is further driven by clients via Hyperledger Caliper, which is a bench mark tool used to measure the performance of blockchain solutions developed on Hyperledger. The results exhibit that the proposed system outperforms other benchmark schemes in terms of throughput and latency etc.",

  "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant growth in the consumption of the most widely diversified Internet of Things (IoT) technological knowledge, and devices, which has resulted in an impact on not only electrical items and the agricultural and food industries (Agri-Food) supply chain networks. This has sparked intense curiosity about the development of information sharing that is reliable, traceable, and transparent, and also increased significant research and advancement efforts. Existing IoT-based trace & authenticity methods for agri-food distribution networks are constructed on top of centralized architectures, which creates the potential for significant issues such as data security, manipulation, and standard points of weakness. A creative and scraping methodological approach to implementing decentralized trust-free networks is represented by blockchain technologies, the decentralized blockchain technologies that underpin cryptocurrencies. The fault tolerance, data integrity, visibility, and complete tracing of saved transactional data, along with cohesive digital information of property resources and independent transactions implementations, are in fact features built into this digitalization. This study introduces Agri-BlockIoT, a completely decentralized blockchain-based traceable platform for managing a global agro-food distribution network that can seamlessly connect IoT systems that produce and consume digital information all along the distribution chain. We implemented a use caseto achieve transparency and traceability. Lastly, we analyzed and contrasted the implementations' capability in terms of delay, CPU, or network utilization.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology is impacting several industries, including the creative industries and those operating in the Internet of Things (IoT). Lately, researchers' attention has been devoted to the application of blockchain in the recorded music industry. However, thus far, no research has investigated the use of such technology in the Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT). The IoMusT is a new area emerging in industry and academy as an extension of the IoT to the musical domain. The IoMusT itself, as the IoT, is a distributed network of musical things, which are objects augmented with information and communication technologies serving a musical purpose. The IoMusT vision requires, above all, IoT features such as decentralization, seamless authentication, transparency, data integrity and privacy, and self-maintenance, as well as the musical domain features such as efficient handling of copyrights and speed of royalties payment. Such features can be brought by blockchain. In this paper, we investigate the integration of blockchain technology with the IoMusT, and we name such synthesis “Blockchain-based IoMusT”. We present a vision for this new paradigm in terms of the novel opportunities that are enabled, and we propose a set of application scenarios enabled by technological integration. Finally, we outline the open research directions in this promising area.",

  "abstract": "The complexity and diversity of socio-economic environments call for a more nuanced consideration of contextualized risks confronting enterprises operating in these environments. By dissecting six cases that successfully adopted blockchain technology in China, we present findings of a grounded theory study into the deployment of blockchain for managing contextualized risks and opportunistic risks. Findings reveal that applying blockchain can augment risk management by controlling opportunistic risk, the latter of which denotes the variability arising from opportunistic practices of internal agents or external parties afforded by their immediate socio-economic environment. Particularly, we not only identify credibility, predatory, and compliance risk as three distinct types of opportunistic risk stemming from the unique socio-economic environment of China, but we also illustrate how blockchain could be leveraged to deal with such opportunistic risks through trust-evoking mechanisms. We discovered that blockchain could evoke trust between individuals-to-organization, organization-to-organization, and organization-to-individuals by bolstering competency, fostering benevolence, and gauging integrity in individual, inter-organizational and intra-organizational contexts, respectively.",

  "title": "The DAG blockchain: A secure edge assisted honeypot for attack detection and multi-controller based load balancing in SDN 5G",
  "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) has increased the need for security due to the participation of illegitimate packets resulting from poor processing times and inadequate resource utilizations. In recent days, wireless 5G users, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) users, have accessed networks from great distances due to their mobility, which requires multiple handovers between communication technologies. However, the process generates illegitimate packets due to connectivity changes. This paper addresses the security issue by using a modified blockchain and handover authentication. The access points (APs) in the infrastructure plane authenticate the 5G users with a hash generation using their identities and pseudo IDs with a lightweight QUARK algorithm. If an excessive number of users are connected with the same AP, then the users’ handover is performed by edge servers based on probabilities. In the data plane, OpenFlow switches perform a flow rule validation and a honeypot implementation for performing the packet validation. Classification of packets into normal, malicious and suspicious packets is also performed at the edge server using a capsule neural network (CapsNet). Deployment of NFV-enabled virtual switches (vSwitch) reduces switch overloading based on the load threshold. For faster validation, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is implemented at the control plane to store the hashed credentials of the users for authentication and the hashed flow rules for flow rule validation. Suspicious packet validation is performed at the control plane by the controller using the Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) algorithm, and the Honey Badger Optimization algorithm (HBO) is used to select an optimal underloaded controller for efficient load balancing. This model is developed in NS-3, and the results show that our model outperforms the existing approaches in terms of QoS metrics such as bandwidth, response time, delay and packet loss, and security metrics such as detection accuracy and authentication time.",

  "abstract": "This study is concerned with the development of the axiomatic design (AD) method under an interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) environment and its application in evaluating blockchain deployment projects in supply chains. Blockchain is a transformative technology that has received significant attention recently. Blockchain technology can process various business transactions by offering a reliable and decentralized infrastructure. Supply chain management is an important application area of blockchains due to its desirable properties, including data security, extended visibility, product traceability, digitalization, and disintermediation. Since blockchain technologies are in their infancy, adopting them to supply chains requires proper design methodologies. Fuzzy AD offers valuable computational mechanisms to evaluate design options in the presence of functional requirements. However, extending AD to different fuzzy extensions is not an easy task, and area-based calculations hinder its widespread applicability. In this study, an IT2F-AD method is developed based on the concept of fuzzy subsethood. The potential of the fuzzy subsethood measure as the main computation engine within type-1 and IT2F-AD is demonstrated. Finally, an integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed by using IT2F Best-Worst Method (IT2F-BWM) and IT2F-AD. The proposed model is used to prioritize blockchain deployment projects in a real-life case study.",

  "abstract": "A software pattern is a reusable solution to address a commonly occurring problem within a given context when designing software. Using patterns is a common practice for software architects to ensure software quality. Many pattern collections have been proposed for a large number of application domains. However, because of the technology's recentness, there are only a few available collections with a lack of extensive testing in industrial blockchain applications. It is also difficult for software architects to adequately apply blockchain patterns in their applications, as it requires deep knowledge of blockchain technology. Through a systematic literature review, this paper has identified 120 unique blockchain-related patterns and proposes a pattern taxonomy composed of multiple categories, built from the extracted pattern collection. The purpose of this collection is to map, classify, and describe all the available patterns across the literature to help readers make adequate decisions regarding blockchain pattern selection. This study also shows potential applications of those patterns and identifies the relationships between blockchain patterns and other non-blockchain software patterns.",

  "abstract": "Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system.

  "title": "A critical review of formal analytical modeling for blockchain technology in production, operations, and supply chains: Harnessing progress for future potential",
  "abstract": "Blockchain technology use cases for supply chains—strategically and operationally—have been highlighted in practice and in research. In this respect, various applications of analytical models have been introduced to understand, analyze and make decisions related to blockchain phenomenon in production, operations, and supply chains. This work has received extensive—and some would argue unprecedentedly--rapid attention within the scholarly community. This early growth sets the stage for large-scale academic research and commercialization. Acknowledging this level of popularity, we provide a critical review of analytical models analyzing the current state-of-the-art research. This includes a synthesis of works that classify different research areas and general analytical model application within each research area. Bibliometric and network analysis tools help identify critical research contributions, key research areas, relationships among analytical models and research areas. Major findings include: (1) analytical models in this field are expanding rapidly; (2) the International Journal of Production Economics has been central to the analytical and production economic modeling research discourse; (3) ten research areas including antecedents, actions, scenarios and consequences are identified from a network analysis; and (4) the relationship between analytical models and research areas is evolving with insight into why and in which direction this work is likely to continue. We identify significant research gaps with great potential for scholarly advancement.",

  "title": "A blockchain-enabled framework for securing connected consumer electronics against wireless attacks",
  "abstract": "The rapid development of the emerging Internet of things (IoT) regime and of smart applications has given rise to many new wireless security vulnerabilities in consumer electronic environment networks, which compromises the integrity of the whole environment. Attacks often encompass the abuse of vulnerable wireless IoT consumer electronics devices, compromise information security, and leak sensitive and private data. This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-enabled framework network infrastructure to improve wireless security and mitigate new wireless attacks on connected consumer electronics as a proof of concept. The system model of the proposed framework was verified mathematically and was then implemented and tested in case studies. The experimental results show that the proposed decentralized blockchain technology-featured air-cracking tool (BTFAT) provides a robust detection of vulnerabilities in the security of wireless-based IoT consumer electronics, i.e., 97% in terms of the effectiveness of packet chapters and 85% in terms of the maximum capture packet reliability, compared with the state of the art.",

  "abstract": "In the past few years, blockchain has proven its necessity and unprecedented prospects in providing a secure environment for information exchange between two parties. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.",

  "abstract": "The emergence of a data-driven society has sparked interest in data trading marketplaces. Traditional centralized marketplaces are unable to meet the needs of a transparent, safe, and privacy-protected data marketplace. To address the above challenges, we propose a data marketplace on blockchain with arbitration using side-contracts mechanisms (dMOBAs), in which a consortium of data owners, data buyers, and arbitrators collaborate to create an ecosystem in the blockchain’s witnesses. Our marketplace’s goals are to provide a decentralized platform for trading personal data for both service providers and data owners. In the meantime, the transaction method can be arbitrated. The arbitrators alliance, which is responsible for resolving data disputes, is formed by a service provider jointly nominated by the buyer and seller. The integrity and value of transacted data can be validated thanks to the arbitrators’ consortium. The side-contracts concept decreases the public chain’s overhead and enhances the marketplace’s operating efficiency. The marketplace’s orderly functioning is ensured by explicit incentives and rigorous arbitration methods. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the mechanisms, we implement dMOBAs on Ethereum, Fabric and IPFS platforms and analyze its performance. According to the testing results, our arbitration method is 2 times faster than full public chain-based arbitration.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based solution for COVID-19 vaccine waste reduction",
  "abstract": "Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been produced on a large scale since 2020. However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today’s systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.",

  "abstract": "Since the advent of blockchain, interest in the technology has rapidly increased, bringing the launch of new blockchain services. User experience (UX) research provides a basis for systematically understanding and improving the experience of users, and must be carried out regardless of service type. However, it seems that research on the UX of blockchain services has not kept up with the speed with which blockchain technology has been implemented. To remedy this situation, this study proposes a UX framework for understanding the nature of UX in blockchain services. An extensive literature survey related to UX, blockchain technology, and blockchain services was conducted to define UX in blockchain services and identify the elements of UX. Blockchain functions and values that had been newly introduced in blockchain services were identified to help clarify the nature of UX in blockchain services. The proposed framework consists of two parts: a general UX and a technological UX. The elements and sub-elements of the defined UX are derived with detailed explanations. The proposed framework was applied to four blockchain services as a case study. The appropriateness and applicability of the framework are supported by the results of this case study. This study is expected to inspire researchers to provide enhanced UX in blockchain services in the future.",

E-health can provide effective and valuable facilities for the patients to monitor. Though, there are protection disputes in the current E-Health system.

A significant problem is that various healthcare organizations keep numerous and fragmented patient medical records. The proposed platform solves this problem by integrating electronic medical reports in a private and permissioned blockchain to create a distributed electronic health record (EHR) ecosystem. In this context, the information processing theory (IPT) allowed us to design and validate a blockchain-based EHR system enhancing the storage of medical records and data exchange among healthcare providers and reducing environmental uncertainty. The potential benefits of the implementation of our distributed network regard clinical outcomes (e.g., improved quality, reduced medical errors), organizational outcomes (e.g., financial, operational benefits), and managerial outcomes (e.g., improved ability to conduct research, improved population health, reduced costs).

  "abstract": "Blockchain technologies have been applied in many areas, from economics, the internet of things to the industrial internet. In order to solve the issue that the Hyperledger Fabric does not currently support Chinese Commercial Cryptographic (CCC) algorithms, we extended the Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider (BCCSP) module in the Hyperledger Fabric by upgrading the original BCCSP module to support the CCC algorithms SM2 and SM3. Furthermore, we designed a transaction process by using UBCCSP (Upgraded BCCSP), and a new smart contract also has been presented. After that, an improved consortium blockchain information system based on UBCCSP named UCBIS (Consortium Blockchain Information System based on UBCCSP) is proposed. In the Hyperledger Fabric transaction process, the identity information and transaction data are protected by the SM2 and SM3 algorithms, moreover, SM3 is also used in the construction process of smart contracts. Our smart contracts reduce the total data amount and improve query efficiency. Finally, the information query system based on UBCCSP is implemented. After being tested and analyzed, the average time for every query is only 31.162 ms in the blockchain system, which has better performance and higher query efficiency.",

  "abstract": "Edge computing has been widely applied in video streaming systems, aiming to provide low-latency video streaming services. However, limited resources and a lack of incentivization affect the performance of edge video streaming systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient Joint computing Offloading and Resource Allocation (JORA) method for blockchain-supported edge video streaming systems (BEVS). Specifically, we develop a novel incentive mechanism based on the blockchain smart contract to enable automatic incentivization. Meanwhile, we customize a system prototype of BEVS on Amazon EC2 using Apache Storm. Preliminary experiments with the customized prototype reveal the coupling impacts of the offloading mode, the allocation scheme, and video redundancy on system performance and resource demand. Motivated by the results, we formulate joint computing offloading, resource allocation, and video adaptive compression as an optimization problem. We transform the original problem into a convex problem and a mixed-integer programming problem (MIP). We then develop an algorithm based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to solve the original problem in an iterative way. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves full resource utilization and an effective trade-off between energy consumption and accuracy.",

Therefore, this paper focus on developing a blockchain-based spectrum trading and sharing system that addresses security concerns and maintains user privacy. Mobile network operators can exchange spectrum without relying on a third party using a Distributed Blockchain Consortium System (DBCS).

  "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of cloud computing, cloud storage services have developed rapidly. One issue that has attracted particular attention in such remote storage services is that cloud storage servers are not enough to reliably save and maintain data, which greatly affects users’ confidence in purchasing and consuming cloud storage services. Traditional data integrity auditing techniques for cloud data storage are centralized, which faces huge security risks due to single-point-of-failure and vulnerabilities of central auditing servers. Blockchain technology offers a new approach to this problem. Many researchers have endeavored to employ the blockchain for data integrity auditing. Based on the search of relevant papers, we found that existing literature lacks a thorough survey of blockchain-based integrity auditing for cloud data. In this paper, we make an in-depth survey on cloud data integrity auditing based on blockchain. Firstly, we cover essential basic knowledge of integrity auditing for cloud data and blockchain techniques. Then, we propose a series of requirements for evaluating existing Blockchain-based Data Integrity Auditing (BDIA) schemes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of existing BDIA schemes and evaluate them based on our proposed criteria. Finally, according to our completed review and analysis, we explore some open issues and suggest research directions worthy of further efforts in the future.",

In recent years, this technology has been discussed in different industries, including the construction sector. Although the advantages of applying DLT in construction projects are numerous, several barriers and limitations are associated with its application. The difficulties are even more exacerbated when examining the uses of DLT for achieving more sustainable buildings. In this context, this article conducts a comprehensive literature review on blockchain, the most discussed DLT technology nowadays, for sustainability, focusing on extending key applications discussed in various fields to the construction industry and real estate. The novelty of this review paper is the presentation of an in-depth discussion of what the next steps in blockchain research should be in order to integrate its applications for achieving a sustainable construction environment with cleaner production and resource use efficiency. A conceptual framework is also proposed to showcase the integration of blockchain with other applications for facilitating the goal of achieving sustainable buildings, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA).",

  "abstract": "Blockchains are commonly used for crypto-currency systems, where they publicly store transactions. In a permissioned blockchain, only a few participants (nodes) can push new transactions to the chain. The known boundary on the number of faulty participants – up to f for 3f+1 participants – may be surpassed, causing the underlying consensus algorithm (BFT) to fail. When a malicious adversary compromises or corrupts enough nodes it may lead to the complete corruption of the ledger and even to the destruction of ledger copies the nodes hold. We suggest a reconstruction solution for the blockchain in the event of such an attack. We present a technique using verifiable secret sharing (VSS), making our solution immediate, requires no trust between the different blockchain parties, and provides each user an independent reconstruction. Our solution enables the exposure of an end-user's private key in case of dishonest reconstruction, thus, removing the incentive of such an act.",

  "title": "A verifiable and privacy-preserving cloud mining pool selection scheme in blockchain of things",
  "abstract": "Blockchain of Things (BCoT), as a new paradigm that incorporates blockchain with the Internet of Things (IoT), can address the privacy and extensibility issues in IoT systems and effectively enhance the data management of IoT devices. Asmost of theIoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of computing power, storage capacity, and energy consumption. Meanwhile,the enormous computational consumption in the consensus process of the blockchain makes it difficult to integrate with IoT closely and exert the great potential of BCoT. latterly, the ”cloud mining” mechanism has been proposed to address these issues, however,some potential problems still exist, such as data privacy and dishonest cloud mining pools, etc. In this paper, we propose a verifiable and privacy-preserving cloud mining pool selection scheme in BCoT (namely, VPP-CMPS). To obtain a better solution for cloud mining pool selection, we implement an improved time-locked puzzles technique to identify dishonest mining pools and perform the authenticity for mining pool selection.Afterwards,we obtain the privacy protection of the data during the entire selection process by adopting additively homomorphic ElGamal cryptosystem. Meanwhile, considering the resource-constrained case in IoT devices, we use a semi-honest cloud server to cooperate in dealing with the selection procedure, thereby reducing the computational overhead of IoT devices. Experimental results indicate that our scheme is more efficient and provides less computational cost.",

  "title": "Blockchain technology for creative industries: Current state and research opportunities",
  "abstract": "Blockchain based NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and smart contracts provide creative industries with exciting opportunities. While they have created a great deal of frenzy in markets, in the frenzy there emerges real value for the industries. Traditionally, creators in the creative industries often need to rely on powerful intermediaries to distribute and profit from their creations. NFT and smart contracts provide creators much closer access to content consumers/buyers. Along this line of thought, this article provides marketing researchers with an overview of the unfolding adoption of NFTs and smart contracts in creative industries. We start by pointing out the market frictions and consequent “transaction costs” that creators face traditionally when distributing their creative content to consumers/buyers. Then, we present the basic ideas of smart contracts and NFTs, discussing how they can transform the market by reducing these transaction costs. Meanwhile, we point out limitations and challenges that creators, buyers, and marketplaces might face in the adoption of NFTs and smart contracts. Finally, we raise an abundance of unexplored research questions interesting to both marketing researchers and practitioners.",

  "abstract": "Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been received extensive attentions. However, substantial CSR investment triggers some suppliers’ greenwashing behaviors which refer to hiding irresponsible operations and exaggerating CSR efforts, and raise concerns from consumers with CSR awareness. In this paper, we explore the impact of blockchain implementation on CSR efforts along a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer under the supplier Stackelberg and retailer Stackelberg models. We consider a group of consumers with CSR awareness who have concerns about the supplier's greenwashing behavior. The adoption of blockchain helps the supply chain members foster consumers’ trust about CSR involvement, by linking CSR related information nodes to blockchain. We identify the conditions where blockchain implementation makes the supplier be more responsible. The supplier has stronger incentives to adopt blockchain when undertaking sufficiently high penalty after violation detection. Under the situation, the supplier makes more CSR efforts which is efficient in the presence of blockchain to eliminate consumers’ concerns about greenwashing. For the retailer, blockchain implementation is beneficial when the detection is efficient enough without blockchain and the penalty cost is not significantly high.",

  "title": "Blockchain assisted clustering with Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Internet of Things environment",
  "abstract": "Industry 4.0 has the potential to create new industrial revolution by offering intelligent, secure, independent, and self-adaptive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. These IIoT nodes can be grouped via the clustering process into clusters to enhance networks’ efficiency, lifetime, and scalability. However, it offers several benefits but still security is a primary concern, which can be resolved by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and blockchain technology. Therefore, an effective Blockchain-Assisted Cluster-based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT, called the BAC-IDS technique has been devised. The proposed BAC-IDS model aims to cluster the IIoT devices for detecting the intrusions and enabling blockchain-based secure data transmission. BAC-IDS technique involves Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)-based clustering technique to choose the Cluster Heads (CH) effectively and construct clusters accordingly. In addition, Chicken Swarm Optimization with Gated Recurrent Unit-based intrusion detection is also followed to determine the presence of intrusions in IIoT environment. Moreover, blockchain technology enables secure data transmission from Cluster Members (CMs) to CHs. The design of HHO clustering and CSO-based hyperparameter optimization for the IIoT environment represents the novelty of the proposed work. A wide range of simulations are performed under different aspects. From experimental results, it has been observed that the BAC-IDS approach has gained a TNR (99.97%), AUC (99.96%), precision (99.99%), recall (99.97%), accuracy (99.98%), F-score (99.98%) and error rate (0.03) on NSL-KDD2015 dataset. Further, on CICIDS 2017 dataset, it has obtained TNR (99.96%), AUC (99.98%), precision (99.96%), recall (99.98%), accuracy (99.97%), F-score (99.96%), and error rate (0.04). The experimental results highlight the supremacy of the proposed BAC-IDS technique over current state-of-art techniques.",

  "abstract": "Today's systems, approaches, and technologies leveraged for managing oil and gas supply chain operations fall short of providing operational transparency, traceability, audit, security, and trusted data provenance features. Also, a large portion of the existing systems are centralized, manual, and highly disintegrated, which make them vulnerable to manipulation and the single point of failure problem. In this survey, we explore the potential opportunities and applications of blockchain technology in managing the exploration, production, and supply chain and logistics operations in the oil and gas industry as it can offer traceability, immutability, transparency, and audit features in a decentralized, trusted, and secure manner. We discuss state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes, research projects, business initiatives, and case studies to highlight the practicability of blockchain in the oil and gas industry. We present the potential opportunities brought about by blockchain technology in various use cases and application scenarios. We present several systems that use blockchain-based smart contracts to automate critical services such as petroleum product tracking and tracing, international trade document protection, and coordination of purchasing and bidding activities for granting oil exploration rights to petroleum exploration and development companies. Finally, we present open challenges acting as future research directions.",

  "title": "A blockchain-based application for genomic access and variant discovery using smart contracts and homomorphic encryption",
  "abstract": "Genomic data repositories are rapidly growing due to the decline in the cost of DNA sequencing. This has increased the demand from stakeholders such as researchers to analyze these datasets to advance areas in biomedical research. Genomic datasets are mostly maintained by third-party direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic companies who operate a business model of collecting DNA data from their customers and selling them to pharmaceutical companies. This puts the privacy of their customers at risk since each individual’s human genome is unique. In addition, customers lose ownership of and access to their genomic data to DTCs and DTCs do not share profits from data sales with them. In this paper, we propose a system based on blockchain technology and homomorphic computation to address the aforementioned problems. We use blockchain transactions and smart contracts to allow genomic data owners (DOs) to have control of their data and sell access to it, and homomorphic computation with secure two-party protocol to enable genomic data users (DUs) to run queries to securely discover DOs of interest. We further optimize the query response time by proposing an approach based on genomic data partitions, binary search trees and bloom filters to reduce the search space. We also propose a blockchain penalty mechanism to encourage parties to behave honestly to avoid malicious behaviors such as uploading fake or non-human genomic data. We conduct our experiments on real genomic datasets and demonstrate that our proposed scheme allows DOs to control access to their data and is feasible and efficient in terms of computation cost, query response time and scalability.",

  "title": "A Survey on blockchain for industrial Internet of Things",
  "abstract": "Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) are separately regarded as highly capable popular technologies. Blockchain is a database used for decentralized transaction purposes. It provides novel directions to store and manage data, whereas IoT relates to the propagation of linked machines by providing information through the Internet. A mixture of Blockchain and the IoT appears hopeful, even though blockchain requires real-time data application, and IoT describes processes to store and manage information overloads safely and proficiently. The technology is significant to the manufacturing business, experiencing a digital revolution by incorporating equipment, developments, and data, leading to the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Such a combination of IIoT and blockchain is termed Blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT). The paper gives a detailed survey on BIIoT and discusses all relevant aspects of this novel concept. Firstly, IoT as a concept has been explored briefly, and relevant threats to IoT has been investigated. Furthermore, the domain of IIoT and the relevant challenges to IIoT is discussed. Additionally, an overview of blockchain technology is presented. Subsequently, a combination of IIoT and blockchain is explored, and the BIIoT structural design proposal is submitted. Finally, issues related to the use of IIoT with blockchain for industrial applications of BIIoT is explored. Thus, all relevant open research directions in Blockchain and IIoT are summarized in this paper. This survey shows that the proposed BIIoT is used to develop a redundant, traceable, and secure complex interconnected IIoT environment. Furthermore, the BIIoT system enables us to communicate with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary in a decentralized, unreliable, peer-to-peer network.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain and big data are the emerging technologies that are on the highest agendas of the firms. These are significantly expected to transform the ways in which the business as well as the firm run. These are on the verge of increasing the expectation of the distributed ledgers, which would keep the firms away from struggling challenges. The concept of big data and Blockchain has been used up by various other concepts that would help secure and interpret the information. The ideal solutions offered by these technologies shall address the challenges of big data management as well as for analytics. In addition to that, Blockchain provides its own consensus method, which is the primary means to create an audit trail. This enables users to verify all transactions. The audit trail is a means of verifying the correctness and integrity of every transaction, regardless of who owns the asset. The Blockchain can also verify that different parties of a transaction are following an agreement and not breaking the agreement. Moreover, there have been continuous arguments in the concept of Blockchain at which the bitcoin is fundamental and there are several popular blockchain approaches developed which would deliver performance, security as well as privacy. Apart from this, the use of Blockchain plays a major role in adding an extra data layer for the big data analytics process. Big data is considered secure which cannot be further forged with the network architecture. The current paper shall be discussing the emerging concepts that are using Blockchain as well as big data.",

  "title": "Can Bitcoin be Trusted? Quantifying the economic value of blockchain transactions",
  "abstract": "Bitcoin is the largest blockchain, and provides the underlying UTXO architecture used by many other cryptocurrencies. We identify an inherent bias embedded in this architecture (the Notebreaker mechanism) which forces users to ‘spend’ the entire content of a wallet address in order to make a payment, receiving ‘change’ into a unique new address. This inflates both the apparent volume transacted and network users, as well as minimizing the apparent fees of transacting. We develop an innovative Transaction Identification Methodology (TIM) to quantify the economic value of transactions from raw blockchain data. Using four different algorithms across three stages, we achieve 95% accuracy in quantifying the degree of bias in these measures. Validated across more than 430 million Bitcoin transactions involving 600 million wallet addresses, our methodology reveals that the Notebreaker mechanism inflates transaction volumes 8 times, makes the actual costs of blockchain transactions appear 3–7 times more expensive than what is commonly reported, and inflates wallet counts – a common heuristic of unique adopter counts. We provide a remediation strategy to make Bitcoin blockchain data a more accurate representation of reality, and provide a daily data set of these remediated volumes and transaction fees.",

  "title": "The implications of blockchain-coordinated information sharing within a supply chain: A simulation study",
  "abstract": "The profitability of a supply chain (SC) is proportional to the stability of all its stakeholders as well as their consistent information sharing with an effective and efficient communication mechanism. Various inefficiencies, such as bullwhip effect (BWE) and product unavailability, may be caused by lack of coordination in a SC. The importance of sharing consumer demand has been quantified by comprehensive studies, under the assumption that all SC participants will access the same information. However, only a few studies have studied the effect of minimal coordination or limited visibility of information, while considering their effect on the overall efficiency of a SC. This work primarily leverages blockchain technology (BCT) to create a simulation model. To do this, a SC bullwhip effect base model is initially developed. Following that, a blockchain-based robust information sharing system is simulated. Furthermore, information sharing is challenging and SC stakeholders may not really trust each other and hence be reluctant to share sensitive information. Considering that, this paper proposed an improved Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm that will increase trust in a decentralized SC model. Multiple experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the simulation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of information sharing in a supply chain via blockchain (BC), as well as that trust between partners tends to increase overall SC efficiency and reduce BWE.",

  "title": "Blockchain humanitarianism and crypto-colonialism",
  "abstract": "A critical political economy approach to new technologies is key to discerning suitable use cases from highly ideological projects. This perspective considers the emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the aid sector. The ability of blockchain enthusiasts to experiment with governance and payment platforms in the developing world is a result of the ascendant private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector, which has increasingly aligned itself with Silicon Valley’s cultural values. This overview of flagship blockchain projects finds end-user solutions and outcomes that principally serve a public-relations (PR) function for the broader crypto-economy and extend colonial legacies of experimentation in the developing world. This paper argues that blockchain humanitarianism is inseparable from crypto-colonialism as the developers, platforms, and rhetoric are interchangeable. A minimal requirement for an ethically sound blockchain humanitarian project would involve acknowledging the risk and ideological extremism of crypto, the importance of developing world sovereignty, and the legacies of colonialism through technological abstraction. The ethical failings of the PPP model in this case should be read alongside the scholarship of Madianou and Nothias and point to the need for developing world platform self-determination analogous to the Non-Aligned Movement’s call for a New World Information and Communication Order.",

  "title": "A drone-based data management and optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and blockchain smart contracts in a secure fog environment",
  "abstract": "The advent of fog computing as an extension of cloud-enabling technology has moved from the hub of the internet framework to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled control and management of drone-based data. The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03% and increase the performance up to 73.11%, thus decreasing the cost of drone-ledger preservation down to 30.13% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .",

  "abstract": "The traditional process of patent registration and trading is very complex, often hindered by challenges related to information security and patent traceability. As a popular emergent technology, blockchain has several useful characteristics such as tamper proof, distributed data management, timestamp, asymmetric encryption, and smart contract. Built upon these characteristics, this paper develops a patent registration and trading system for improved information security, immutability, transparency, and traceability. This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed to highlight the significance of our proposed method.",

  "title": "Security of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks using blockchain: A comprehensive review",
  "abstract": "The most advanced and emerging component of an intelligent transportation system (ITS) is the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Vehicles communicate with nearby vehicles or road side units (RSUs) in order to provide safety or non-safety information. This information containing vehicle ID, current position, speed and vehicle status is shared periodically among nearby vehicles. VANET provides tremendous benefits to drivers, but due to its inherent characteristics, it is important to address security and privacy issues before it can be fully adopted. It is required to authenticate the vehicles participating in the network and held responsible in case any type of misbehavior is encountered in the network. Traditional centralized security solutions are not suitable in VANET because of high speed of vehicles, minimal communication resources and delay sensitive applications. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed computing platform that makes it easier to record and manage resources without relying on a centralized trusted authority. Therefore, blockchain based solution is expedient in VANET scenario which provides transparency, tamper resistance and immutableness. This paper aims to envision a comprehensive review on applications of blockchain in VANET security. We first present the introduction of VANET security and blockchain. Then, we conduct a literature review on the existing security solutions using blockchain in VANET by considering the technical issues and research problems. At last, we highlight some future research issues by reviewing the characteristics of both blockchain and VANET.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology has taken on a leading position in today’s industrial applications by providing salient features and showing significant performance since its beginning. Blockchain began its journey from the concept of cryptocurrency and is now part of a range of core applications to achieve resilience and automation between various tasks. However, with the integration of Blockchain technology into different industrial applications, many application designs, security, and privacy challenges present themselves, posing serious threats to users and their data. Although several approaches have been proposed to address the specific application, security and privacy challenges of targeted applications with limited security enhancement solutions, there is still a need for a comprehensive research study on the application design, security and privacy challenges, and requirements of Blockchain-based industrial applications, along with possible security threats and countermeasures. This study presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications, focusing on potential application design, security and privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. We also analyse and provide the classification of security and privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance the advancement of security features. Furthermore, we highlight some open issues of integrating Blockchain technology into industrial applications that help design secure Blockchain-based applications as future directions.",

  "title": "Hierarchical blockchain structure for node authentication in IoT networks",
  "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) networks are large peer-to-peer networks of small devices that require a competent security system that is scalable and adaptable to the limited resources of the IoT devices. Node authentication is a crucial part of IoT security. The current authentication solutions require a centralized trusted party for authentication, which presents a single point of failure. Blockchain as a peer-to-peer network with decentralized authentication can provide a decentralized solution for node authentication. In existing literature, most blockchain applications in IoT are connected to existing blockchain networks by more computationally capable devices, thereby limiting their adaptability for IoT networks and presenting single point of failure problem. Considering the issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized structure for authentication by arranging the IoT devices into clusters based on their computational capability, energy reserve and their location. The devices in each cluster are authenticated by a hierarchical structure of interconnected blockchains. To reduce the processing load we introduced a consensus protocol based on verifying identity-based encryption key signature of the device and its related cluster. The proposed structure simulation has shown a reduction of the processor and memory load of IoT devices. Further testing using Docker container network and Raspberry Pi devices network has shown that the proposed blockchain structure and consensus algorithm have reduced computational load. The analysis of the structure security and performance shows it offers comprehensive security protection while being lightweight and scalable.",

  "abstract": "Owing to the incremental and diverse applications of cryptocurrencies and the continuous development of distributed system technology, blockchain has been broadly used in fintech, smart homes, public health, and intelligent transportation due to its properties of decentralization, collective maintenance, and immutability. Although the dynamism of blockchain abounds in various fields, concerns in terms of network communication interference and privacy leakage are gradually increasing. Because of the lack of reliable attack analysis systems, fully understanding some attacks on the blockchain, such as mining, network communication, smart contract, and privacy theft attacks, has remained challenging. Therefore, in this study, we examine the security and privacy of the blockchain and analyze possible solutions. We systematical classify the blockchain attack techniques into three categories, then discuss the corresponding attack and defense methods based on these categories. We focus on (1) the attack and defense methods of mining pool attacks for blockchain security issues, such as block withholding, 51%, pool hopping, selfish mining, and fork after withholding attacks, in the attack type of consensus excitation; (2) the attack and defense methods of network communication and smart contracts for blockchain security issues, such as distributed denial-of-service, Sybil, eclipse, and reentrancy attacks, in the attack type of middle protocol; and (3) the attack and defense methods of privacy thefts for blockchain privacy issues, such as identity privacy and transaction information attacks, in the attack type of application service. Finally, we discuss future research directions for blockchain security.",

  "title": "RON-enhanced blockchain propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities",
  "abstract": "Edge computing can serve latency-sensitive data generated by smart IoT devices in smart cities, which cannot be accommodated by cloud services. However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.",

A conjoint experiment was conducted where participants (n=84) assigned scores to stimuli cards according to preference in a specific shopping scenario. Results showed that “blockchain trademarked” did not have much impact relative to “low price” and “high product rating”. Further analysis showed that “blockchain trademarked” had a relatively stronger impact towards those participants (n=22) who indicated that living a sustainable lifestyle is important. Our findings show that there is a need for educating consumers about blockchain and the associated benefits for improving future transparency in sustainability in the fashion industry. Overall, these findings provide valuable grounds for further research on how blockchain-enabled sustainability labeling can create value for both consumers and companies within the fashion industry.",

  "abstract": "The digitalization of the power grid and advancement in intelligent technologies have enabled the service provider to convert the existing electrical grid into a smart grid. The transformation of the grid will help in integrating cleaner energy technologies with energy management to improve power network efficiency. Internet of things (IoT) and various network components need to be deployed to harness the full potential of the smart grid. Also, integrating intermittent renewable energy sources, energy storage, intelligent control of selected power-intensive loads, etc will improve energy efficiency. But deployment of this information and communication technologies will make the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks from hackers. In this work, blockchain-based self-sovereign identification and authentication technique is presented to avert identity theft and masquerading. The proposed approach can minimize the chances of identity-based security breaches in the smart grid. This paper provides an overview of the model of identification and authentication of IoT devices in Smart Grid based on Blockchain technology. The Blockchain based implementation of identification and authentication of devices is proposed to validate the model in the distributed electrical energy network. The model is able to authenticate the device using Blockchain in a trusted model. The system works according to plan validating the authenticity of transaction in a node in log(n) time, which justifies presented result.",

  "title": "A survey on blockchain for big data: Approaches, opportunities, and future directions",
  "abstract": "Big data has generated strong interest in various scientific and engineering domains over the last few years. Despite many advantages and applications, there are many challenges in big data to be tackled for better quality of service, e.g., big data analytics, big data management, and big data privacy and security. Blockchain with its decentralization and security nature has the great potential to improve big data services and applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on blockchain for big data, focusing on up-to-date approaches, opportunities, and future directions. First, we present a brief overview of blockchain and big data as well as the motivation behind their integration. Next, we survey various blockchain services for big data, including blockchain for secure big data acquisition, data storage, data analytics, and data privacy preservation. Then, we review the state-of-the-art studies on the use of blockchain for big data applications in different domains such as smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart grid. For a better understanding, some representative blockchain-big data projects are also presented and analyzed. Finally, challenges and future directions are discussed to further drive research in this promising area.",

  "title": "Max–min fairness based faucet design for blockchains",
  "abstract": "In order to have transactions executed and recorded on blockchains such as the Ethereum Mainnet, fees expressed in crypto-currency units of the blockchain must be paid. One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum blockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test networks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as Bloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets. Since transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions are consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small amounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some small amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result, rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more general distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary amounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this end, Max–min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralised settings. Our work contributes a Max–min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart contract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the number of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart contract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users would mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making the smart contract ineffective. We report tests which confirm that the low transaction cost aims have been achieved by our algorithm.",

Identity management is believed to be the fundamental keystone to build security mechanisms. The traditional centralized identity management scheme suffers from a single point of failure and identity forgery. A secure IoT system framework was proposed leveraging blockchain as the basic infrastructure with Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) identifying the sensors uniquely. We brought up a scheme to improve the identity authentication protocol. Experiments showed that our approach was more effective and secure against attacks.",

  "abstract": "The Internet of things technology has accelerated the development of e-health solutions and allows patients to obtain a more satisfying medical service experience. Each electronic health system(EHS) usually allows its subsystems to manage and access patient data to achieve its unique objective. Due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of the terminal, it is difficult to protect large amounts of patients’ medical record data in EHS. Medical data are a meaningful medical history resource, and are very important for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients. The privacy and integrity protection of medical data is a on-negotiable requirement for rational application in traditional medical systems. To achieve secure resource sharing and efficient service provision between users and medical service providers, we present a blockchain-based decentralized authentication and access control protocol for EHS that addresses broader medical data privacy and security needs. A practical Byzantine fault-tolerant(PBFT) negotiation mechanism based on multi-weighted subjective logic is adopted to improve the negotiation process. Finally, using BAN logic, we prove the reliability of the systems-security protections, which demonstrates that our proposal can withstand known security attacks.",

The work devises the Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Algorithm Framework (DLEBAF) with different strategies. The first strategy is deadline-efficient task sequencing and scheduling (DETS), which allocates all applications (workloads) according to their deadline. The second strategy is latency-efficient task scheduling (LETS) to minimize the latency of workloads. The third strategy is energy-efficient task scheduling (EETS), which reduces the energy of fog nodes. The blockchain-enabled fog–cloud (BEFC) scheme ensures the blockchain validation, hashing, previous hash, and time of applications in the system. The results will compare the optimal energy results and delay existing studies with the proposed work. Results showed that the proposed method improves by 30% energy and 50% training delay of all applications.",

  "title": "Truthful auction mechanisms for resource allocation in the Internet of Vehicles with public blockchain networks",
  "abstract": "Recording vehicle driving data into the blockchain can effectively solve problems of data authenticity and security, which is a focus of research on blockchain and the Internet of Vehicles. However, when using blockchain technology, the proof-of-work completed by vehicles may consume substantial energy and computing resources, which limits the application of blockchain technology in the internet of vehicles environment. Therefore, this paper considers deploying edge computing nodes to support blockchain technology and introducing an auction mechanism to encourage users to record vehicle driving data as miners. This paper proposes two auction mechanisms for the blockchain network formed by edge computing service providers and miners to maximize the social welfare. Specifically, one mechanism is used when the resource demands of the miners are the same, and the other is used when the resource demands of the miners are different. For resource allocation, the former uses the maximum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve optimal allocation, and the latter uses a heuristic algorithm. For price payment, the former uses the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism, and the latter uses dichotomy. These two price payment algorithms use critical value theory to calculate the payment price. This paper demonstrates that both are truthful and individually rational. Through experiments, this paper evaluates indicators such as social welfare, satisfaction, and resource utilization. The experiments show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively maximize social welfare in the blockchain network and provide an effective resource allocation strategy for edge computing service providers.",

Recognizing a gap in the existing literature, this paper aims to answer the research question “To what extent does a blockchain-based governance model for COVID-19 digital health certificates in the EU meet the relevant legal, technical, ethical and security requirements?” This paper identifies the required standards and develops a novel framework to determine the viability of blockchain as a governance model. The results of our evaluation indicate that while a private permissioned blockchain can meet the requirements to some degree, the governance element is key to legal compliance; legal risks and ethical implications remain unresolved with the use of blockchain. The paper also found that this model comes with the loss of the main advantages of blockchain – decentralization and anonymity. This evaluation framework may be used in other contexts and for assessing other technologies.",

  "abstract": "Alliance blockchains provide a multi-party trusted data trading environment, promoting the development of the data trading market in which the value compensation for personal data is still a key issue. However, limited by the data format and content, traditional attempts on data value compensation cannot form a widely applicable solution. Therefore, we propose a universal value compensation method for personal data in alliance blockchains. The basic idea of this method is to evaluate the value weight of data based on the collaborative relationship of data value. First, we construct a Data Collaboration Markov Model (DCMM) to formalize the collaboration network of data value. Then, aiming at data collaboration networks with different structures, the corresponding Segmented PageRank (SPR) algorithm is proposed. SPR can universally evaluate the value weight of each data account without being subjected to the data format or content. Finally, we theoretically deduce that the time complexity and space complexity of SPR algorithm are respectively 1/K and 1/K2 taken by PageRank algorithm. Experiments show the feasibility and superior performance of SPR.",

  "title": "SSBAS-FA: A secure sealed-bid e-auction scheme with fair arbitration based on time-released blockchain",
  "abstract": "Electronic auctions are becoming more and more popular in business activities, which provide the professionals with competitive prices for their products, pitching the suppliers directly against each other to allow suppliers to bid online against a published specification. In sealed-bid e-auctions, bidders send sealed-bid envelopes to auctioneer and auctioneer only can open them after a certain period of time to announce the highest bidder. In order to solve the issue of the opacity of whole sealed-bid auction process, researchers try to solve this problem by incorporating the blockchain technique into the e-auction systems with the properties of unforgeable transaction and public ledger of the blockchain. However, since the auctioneer might open the bid envelope before the deadline of the auction, it can tamper the bid price by colluding with malicious bidders for personal profit. In this paper, we propose a time-released blockchain-based sealed-bid e-auction scheme. We use time-lock encryption to ensure that the bidders’ bid data will not be available to anyone until a specified time, thus guaranteeing the security of the bidders’ data. At the same time, we use smart contracts for auction verification, which further improves the security of the scheme and avoids tampering by malicious auctioneers. In addition, we propose a secure sealed-bid e-auction scheme with fair arbitration (namely, SSBAS-FA), that is based on time-released blockchain to provide a fair arbitration mechanism in punishing malicious bidders. We give the deployment of a time-released blockchain that eliminates the demand of the trusted third party to perform the validation of the smart contract. We provide the fair arbitration for the bidder and auctioneer. The security analysis and performance evaluation indicate that our scheme is secure, fair and efficient in sealed-bid e-auction system.",

  "title": "Alleviating the Impact of the Barriers to Circular Economy Adoption Through Blockchain: An Investigation Using an Integrated MCDM-based QFD With Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets",
  "abstract": "Despite its clear potential to contribute to sustainability, there are many challenges to adopting circular economy (CE). These barriers impede the implementation of CE; however, research to address them is ongoing. For example, novel technologies have become a key enabler for easing the impact of CE adoption barriers. Blockchain is one disruptive technology that has the potential to address some of those barriers, notably technological, organizational, and ecological. Blockchain is particularly well suited to help address supply chain-oriented barriers to CE adoption. However, a review of the literature shows that while there are a limited number of conceptual studies that address the capabilities of blockchain to alleviate the impact of the barriers to CE, no previous study has focused on this vital subject using a decision tool based on expert data. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated decision framework involving Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method with Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) to investigate the true potential of blockchain to address the CE adoption barriers. Our findings indicate that enhanced supply chain traceability management, improved collaboration and coordination in supply chain ecosystems, building higher levels of trust in supply chain ecosystems, and enhanced business models are the most significant functions of blockchain to help overcome the CE adoption barriers.",

  "abstract": "The wealth of user data acts as a fuel for network intelligence toward the sixth generation wireless networks (6G). Due to data heterogeneity and dynamics, decentralized data management (DM) is desirable for achieving transparent data operations across network domains, and blockchain can be a promising solution. However, the increasing data volume and stringent data privacy-preservation requirements in 6G bring significantly technical challenge to balance transparency, efficiency, and privacy requirements in decentralized blockchain-based DM. In this paper, we investigate blockchain solutions to address the challenge. First, we explore the consensus protocols and scalability mechanisms in blockchains and discuss the roles of DM stakeholders in blockchain architectures. Second, we investigate the authentication and authorization requirements for DM stakeholders. Third, we categorize DM privacy requirements and study blockchain-based mechanisms for collaborative data processing. Subsequently, we present research issues and potential solutions for blockchain-based DM toward 6G from these three perspectives. Finally, we conclude this paper and discuss future research directions.",

  "title": "Blockchain-assisted industrial automation beyond 5G networks",
  "abstract": "Automation of industrial tasks becomes the necessity of organizations due to high risks and low operational efficiency associated with traditional procedures. The industrial Internet-of-thing (IIoT) has proved it a reality with ubiquitous computing, which interconnects tens of billions of objects, such as devices and machines, for real-time data transfer. However, the rapid increase in the number of connected devices and machines leads to various security issues, such as data modification, sniffing, and many more. Achieving secure and reliable communication between devices becomes challenging as the entire communication takes place over an open channel, i.e., the Internet. Most of the security solutions presented in the literature are centralized and susceptible to security, latency, reliability, and single-point-of-failure issues. Blockchain is a plausible solution to mitigate the aforementioned issues with reduced capital and operating expenditures, whereas the sixth-generation (6G) network makes communication faster and more reliable. Motivated by these facts, this paper presents an exhaustive survey on blockchain-based industrial automation in the 6G environment. Also, a blockchain and 6G-enabled industrial automation architecture for secure and efficient communication among IIoT devices is proposed. This paper also presents a case study on blockchain-based additive manufacturing for designing three-dimensional products to validate the proposed architecture. The performance of the proposed case study is evaluated based on network parameters such as delay, packet loss, scalability, network bandwidth, computation time, and data storage cost. Finally, various research challenges and future directions are suggested in this emerging area.",

  "abstract": "Secure communication is one of the main challenges that are slowing down the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Key Management (KM) is particularly a difficult security issue, mainly because of the lack of resources of the IoT devices. Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change. To decentralize the KM, we use the blockchain technology and smart contracts. We show that the system continues to operate when an entity fails and that the compromise of an entity does not jeopardize the whole network. We also prove that our solution fulfills the IoT requirements in terms of security and performance. Finally, we propose an implementation on IoT platforms to validate our theoretical analysis and simulation results.",

  "title": "Towards a blockchain-SDN-based secure architecture for cloud computing in smart industrial IoT",
  "abstract": "Some of the significant new technologies researched in recent studies include Blockchain (BC), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Smart Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). All three technology provide data integrity, confidentiality, and integrity in their respective use cases (especially in industrial fields). Additionally, cloud computing has been in use for several years now. Confidential information is exchanged with cloud infrastructure to provide clients with access to distant resources, such as computing and storage activities in the IIoT. There are also significant security risks, concerns, and difficulties associated with cloud computing. To address these challenges, we propose merging BC and SDN into a cloud computing platform for the IIoT. This paper introduces “DistB-SDCloud”, an architecture for enhanced cloud security for smart IIoT applications. The proposed architecture uses a distributed BC method to provide security, secrecy, privacy, and integrity while remaining flexible and scalable. Customers in the industrial sector benefit from the dispersed or decentralized, and efficient environment of BC. Additionally, we described an SDN method to improve the durability, stability, and load balancing of cloud infrastructure. The efficacy of our SDN and BC-based implementation was experimentally tested using various parameters including throughput, packet analysis, response time, bandwidth, and latency analysis, as well as the monitoring of several attacks on the system itself.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology is considered a logical solution to the problems of security, privacy and trust in the collection, storage and sharing of data related to the elderly in the elderly care industry (ECI); however, its adoption in the ECI remains in its initial stage. To improve the efficiency of adopting this technology in the ECI and to facilitate decision-making by managers, this study combines the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology–organisation–environment framework models to study the factors affecting blockchain adoption intention in the ECI. In addition, the direct predictors of the relative advantages of blockchain technology in the ECI are explored. Through a questionnaire survey of 124 elderly care institutions in China, we collected 181 valid questionnaires and analysed them using a partial least squares regression structural equation model. The results show that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility, top management support and organisational readiness have a positive effect on blockchain adoption intention in the ECI, while the effects of complexity, government support and competitive pressure are insignificant. However, competitive pressure and government support can indirectly promote blockchain adoption intention by influencing top management support. Furthermore, technology trust and information security positively affect the relative advantages of blockchain technology and indirectly affect blockchain adoption intention, while privacy protection is insignificant.",

  "title": "Blockchain-Enabled Searchable Encryption in Clouds: A Review",
  "abstract": "Nowadays, the demand of storage and computational resources is increasing. As a result, the number of organisations and individuals that outsource their data to cloud is also increasing. Since data privacy and security are the main concerns, the users always encrypt their data before uploading the data to the cloud server. However, it obstructs the search operation which is one of the basic data utilisation. Search operation can be seen as one of the most important function in daily life as people frequently search for data they wanted. When the uploaded data is encrypted, the capability of a server to search for certain keyword is limited as it is not able to carry out a plaintext keyword search on encrypted data. In order to realise the privacy needs, a cryptographic primitive called searchable encryption that allows the search of keyword over the uploaded data that is encrypted is introduced. The concept of searchable encryption has been presented to enable data users to search for certain keyword over the encrypted data without leaking any information to the cloud server. However, most of the conventional searchable encryption schemes do not offer features that satisfy the real-world application such as fair payment, verifiability of search result, etc. While blockchain is well-known with its features such as decentralised, integrity, and immutability, thus blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes will be discussed on how it can be used to overcome or complement the downsides of conventional searchable encryption. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes will be reviewed and compared.",

  "abstract": "No doubt that medical data sharing is very crucial but important in realizing cross-hospital diagnosis and improving research development. In traditional mechanisms, there always exists a tradeoff between correctness of medical data and patient privacy. Here we are going to introduce the concept of blockchain and smart contract to build up an electronic medical record sharing mechanism: medical blockchain. Specifically, we have implemented the medical record sharing through cryptography design. Simulations have demonstrated that the correctness of medical data and privacy of patient can be guaranteed through the adoption of blockchain, while the integrity of a specific patient can be achieved via the smart contract control. Furthermore, the proposed medical blockchain can resist the potential Internet attack simulated by the formal verification. Thus, no leakage of patient identity occurs, and the tradeoff could be eliminated effectively without the modification of current hospital devices according to the simulation results.",

  "title": "Privacy protection federated learning system based on blockchain and edge computing in mobile crowdsourcing",
  "abstract": "With the rapid popularization and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) has become an indispensable part in today’s society. However, when task participants submit tasks, they are likely to expose their data privacy and location privacy. These privacy will be maliciously attacked and exploited by attackers (external attackers and untrusted third party). With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system. The system protects data privacy and location privacy by using the Double local disturbance Localized Differential Privacy (DLD-LDP) proposed in this paper. Because the sensed data exists in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.), this paper uses the Multi-modal Transformer (MulT) method to merge the multi-modal data before subsequent operations. To solve the problem that the third party is untrusted, we utilize Blockchain to distribute tasks and collect models in a distributed way. A reputation calculation method (Sig-RCU) is proposed to calculate the real-time reputation of task participants. Through conducting experiments on real data sets, the effectiveness and adaptation of the proposed DLD-LDP algorithm and Sig-RCU algorithm are verified.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain technology is considered to be a disruptive technology that has real potential for change after steam engines, electricity, and the Internet. However, in terms of power generation, the current level of hydropower development in my country is only 39%. Compared with developed countries, there is still a big gap and a high development space. This article proposes a research on the application of blockchain technology in smart sustainable energy business models, studies the conversion path of sustainable energy systems, introduces integrated energy service blockchain technology, and builds a sustainable energy transition model. The selection of practical dimensions requires both Quantitative indicators also require cultural and behavioral qualitative indicators; finally, through the analysis of social development trends and government policies, the external variable landscape signals are parameterized. Sustainable energy rather than fossil energy is the energy of the future. Weak landscape signals have significantly weakened the development of the sustainable energy niche: the proportion of coal consumption has declined slowly. Although it has transformed from a system to a niche, it has always been higher than that of other energy types. Only with long-term landscape pressure, positive changes to sustainable energy technologies and infrastructure, and continuous changes in consumer preferences, can sustainable energy ultimately dominate.",

  "abstract": "In the study, we propose a double blockchain based vehicular system for optimizing data storage and securing communication in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. We propose an incentive mechanism and a reputation system to reduce the selfish and distrustful behavior of IoV nodes. Moreover, we propose an encryption technique to protect the proposed system from passive and active attacks. The proposed technique is a hybrid of Rivest Shamir Adleman and Advanced Encryption Standard-256 (AES-256+RSA). We use this hybrid approach to efficiently and secretly share the users' secret keys. To address the issues of high resource consumption and communication delay, we propose a cache memory technique for miner and controller nodes. In addition, we propose an authentication mechanism to remove malicious nodes from the system. The simulation results depict that our system provides security, scalability, optimized data storage, node's trustworthiness, and transparent data sharing.",

  "abstract": "“Blockchain” is a buzzword that has captured attention from researchers in almost every possible domain. In a blockchain ecosystem, multiple parties across the network have to establish trust in an untrusted environment to ensure seamless nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation is a crucial factor for secure information auditing in the blockchain. To achieve this, we require an optimal digital signature. In this work, we design a digital signature to address the nonrepudiation challenge in blockchain ecosystems. Our approach developed in the current work completed signing and verification tasks with 10% and 13% shorter processing times, respectively than the conventional digital signature scheme. The adoption of the high-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) in a blockchain ecosystem can yield a 10% improvement in the transaction flow, a 10% improvement in block validation and a 40% decrease in storage costs relative to the same system implemented without HECAS. Finally, we simulated various blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and experimented with our scheme. The results show that our work can produce convincing, consistent results across various sensor data types from smart IoT-based blockchain solutions.",

  "abstract": "The selfish On-Board-Unit (OBU) attacks Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) by various attacks for profit. However, many existing methods are based on the principle of direct reciprocity for communication, which makes it easy for large-scale networks to crash when an attack occurs. In order to reduce the number of attackers in the vehicle ad hoc network and restrain the attack motivation of the OBUs, we propose an indirect reciprocal incentive mechanism based on reputation to encourage the OBUs in the VANET to help each other. Since most OBUs are in great need of network services, including potential attackers, when the loss of network services is far greater than the illegal benefits of their attacks, selfish and rational OBUs will give up attacks and take desirable behavior. In addition, to prevent some attacks from tampering with information, we also apply blockchain technology to record the behavior of OBU. The indirect reciprocity process of each OBU in VANET can be regarded as Markov Decision Process (MDP). In order to restrain the attack motivation of selfish nodes and communicate normally without knowing the attack model, an algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed to suppress attack motivation, so as to activate OBU learning in a dynamic environment and make wise decisions. Finally, through a large number of simulation experiments, the performance of our proposed algorithm is obviously better than that of the baseline strategy, and is verified by the simulation results.",

  "title": "Antecedents of Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platforms (BEEP) adoption by customers – A study of second-hand small and medium apparel retailers",
  "abstract": "Increasingly, the apparel industry generates enormous waste and pollution causing extreme water scarcity in emerging economies, where circular economy (CE) adoption can help to alleviate these pressing issues of this century. Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer’s buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.",

The overall purpose of this pilot is to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the diplomas for all involved stakeholders and therefore to contribute to solving the diploma counterfeiting and/or falsification that is a great threat to the recruitment of qualified personnel. The main innovative aspect of this solution is the integration that is offered between an Academic Management System (the Fenix.edu platform) and a Blockchain (Ethereum) to automatically deploy diplomas. This solution helps the involved stakeholders trust the diplomas provided. The case study involves four different stakeholders and studies, specifically, the increase in their satisfaction in terms of diploma control, diploma veracity, and diploma credibility. The developed system was tested with external participants who were asked to follow a set of guidelines and complete a survey to assess their perceptions. All system interactions were recorded, and the data were analyzed. The results indicated that the participants successfully executed the guidelines and that a perception increase toward diploma control, veracity, and credibility was identified.",

  "abstract": "Due to the limitations of data quality and quantity of a single industrial user, the development of intelligent machinery fault diagnosis methods has been reaching a bottleneck in the perspectives of both academic research and engineering applications in the recent years. Collaborative fault diagnosis model development has been receiving increasing attention, where the distributed data at different users are explored simultaneously. However, data security and privacy are the major industrial concerns, which have not been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized federated transfer learning method is proposed for collaborative machinery fault diagnosis. A tailored committee consensus scheme is designed for optimization of the model aggregation process, and a source data-free transfer learning method is further proposed. After global model initialization, the fault diagnosis model can be built through iterations of committee member selection, performance evaluation, transfer learning, model aggregation and blockchain updates. The experiments on two decentralized fault diagnosis datasets are implemented for validations, and higher than 90% testing accuracies can be generally achieved. The experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective in data privacy-preserving collaborative fault diagnosis of multiple users. It offers a promising tool for applications in the real industrial scenarios.",

  "abstract": "Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.",

  "abstract": "The adoption of blockchain-based technologies by organisations can bring benefits in terms of firms' profitability, productivity and efficiency, making companies rethink their existing business models. However, as the technology is still developing and the research on the implications of the different types of blockchain networks (i.e. public, private, consortium) is scarce, their role in business model innovation requires closer attention. To address this gap, the paper provides a conceptual insight into the role of blockchain technology in companies with different value configurations by examining the technological conditions that can impact business models and probing the role of technology benefits in driving company value. The analysis contributes to the literature by discussing the business implications of innovative technologies and uncovering their positive and negative consequences for the value creation, delivery and capture activities. Such analysis sheds light on the functions of blockchains that have a differentiating impact on business processes. Also, the paper puts forward managerial implications by discussing the paths of business model innovation using blockchain technologies.",

Cryptocurrencies - with bitcoin the first and most prominent one – have become highly relevant on the financial markets. The underlying technology for crypto money follows a distributed ledger concept called blockchain. However, blockchain technology today amounts to much more than storing virtual money, having gained new ground with the capability to implement so-called smart contracts, i.e., software code as part of the chain. In this discussion we outline the concept of distributed ledgers and blockchain and outline fundamentals of smart contracts. Finally, proof of concepts and first applications exemplify the options that companies now have to enhance their business.",

  "abstract": "As a decentralized database technology, blockchain is increasingly being applied to smart grids. This paper proposes a blockchain-based smart microgrid power transaction model. The model realizes the power dispatching between users and agents in the microgrid through two-way auctions and point-to-point transactions and optimizes energy allocation through market regulation. And based on the Ethereum private chain, it ensures the openness, transparency, safety, and reliability of transactions. The simulation results show that the open and reliable features of the blockchain improve the efficiency of power dispatching, and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.",

  "title": "Financing and operating strategies for blockchain technology-driven accounts receivable chains",
  "abstract": "We focus on blockchain technology (BCT) adoption in a three-echelon supply chain in which upstream sellers offer trade credits to capital-constrained downstream buyers, forming an accounts receivable chain. According to different supply chain partners adopting BCT, we analyze the game equilibrium of the no, upper-stream, lower-stream, and entire BCT-driven accounts receivable chains (NBC, UBC, LBC, and EBC) to understand participants’ motivation and condition to adopt BCT and the different roles of participants in blockchain introduction. We find that trade credit management cost-saving and repayment risk-sharing effects, as facilitated by BCT, help increase the equilibrium order quantity, thereby increasing supply chain efficiency and participants’ profits, although BCT cannot fully coordinate the supply chain. Regarding supply chain efficiency, EBC is superior to LBC, which is better than UBC or NBC. As a supply chain leader and creditor, the supplier plays a passive role in achieving the positive effect of BCT. Given that the retailer and manufacturer are supply chain followers and debtors, their adoption of BCT is the key to enhancing supply chain efficiency and profits. The BCT platform can set appropriate technology-usage fees to guide participants to form the EBC structure through different paths. Meanwhile, the retailer’s initial working capital can evaluate the risk-sharing degree of the supply chain, and the stable EBC selection region defined by the risk-sharing degree can be ascertained. We further find that with the trade credit insurance premium increasing, supply chain participants have become more active in adopting BCT.",

  "abstract": "Blockchains are a key disruptive technology of recent times with applications across several application domains such as finance, supply chain, healthcare and Industry 4.0. With growing application types, scalability of blockchains has emerged as a key challenge in achieving the potential of this technology. This paper attempts to outline this challenge for blockchains as follows. It highlights blockchain scalability as a composite concept which can be interpreted in various ways i.e. expanding the number of participants of the network, or enhancing capabilities of the participants (such as processing, memory, storage or an efficient consensus strategy) to minimize the scalability overhead. Further, it presents a first thorough systemic study of existing efforts to achieve blockchain scalability with respect to; (i) innovative methods and mechanisms to strengthen blockchain’s capabilities with respect to scalability, (ii) approaches leveraging blockchains to achieve scalable applications, and (iii) efforts analyzing blockchain solutions with respect to scalability. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, the paper identifies contributions as well as open challenges which can help research community to advance knowledge within this domain.",

  "abstract": "With the continuous development of edge computing and IIoT technology, there are growing types of IIoT devices, and the number of such devices is continuously climbing. It is indispensable to authenticate devices in the IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose two blockchain-based authentication for IIoT devices with PUF. The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.",

  "abstract": "Due to the hierarchical management structure of electric power enterprises, data flow often needs to go through multiple layers of nodes for review, which makes data synchronization slow and distortion high and data reliability difficult to improve. The existing data asset management mode of electric power enterprises faces security problems such as node trustworthiness and data tampering in the process of identity mutual trust, transmission and storage, data collection and data usage. In view of this, this paper proposes a blockchain-based digital asset management framework using the decentralized, untrustworthy, and hard-to-tamper features of blockchain. In the proposed framework, we optimized security authentication mechanism, data recording and consensus process, and data storage and transmission strategy involved in blockchain data sharing applications. The framework can effectively ensure the security, integrity, operability and consistency of digital assets in the management process under the blockchain environment.",

  "abstract": "Non-profit organization raise charity donation through different sources, and raised funds often require a clean traceability. Recently, fake charity fundraisers schemes have raised a social concern, and thus a trusted and auditable approach is necessary to manage charity organizations reputations. Blockchain-based charity (BBC) schemes are proposed with decentralization that ensure trust, transparency, and chronology among donators and beneficiaries. However, the schemes suffer from the high-end complexity of certificate generation. Motivated from this, in this paper, we propose a BBC scheme, UpHaaR, where donators, defined as charity persons (CP), and beneficiaries, defined as charity beneficiaries (CB), register in blockchain, managed for diverse fundraisers by charity organizations (CO). The scheme mitigates fake fundraisers, as the charity scheme data and fund allocations to CP are managed as ledger entries in the blockchain. To maintain the security and privacy of massive CP and CB users, the scheme proposes partial key generations through certificate-less cryptography (CLC), which mitigates expensive digital signing and eliminates certificate generation through key distribution centers. For signature aspects, the scheme proposes a lightweight certificate-less signcryption scheme (CSS) that eliminates collusion against insider attacks and reduces computational costs. The scheme is evaluated for security analysis using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and informal attack analysis, and cost evaluations. The proposed results indicate the scheme’s viability against similar conventional approaches.",

Indeed, this is owing to the fact that it has distinct qualities and a distinctive design. However, it is not well suited to all applications of blockchain technology. Not merely altering the blockchain protocols would make it suitable, but instead redesigning its architecture is required to make it ideal for different applications. This paper describes the overview of blockchain technology thoroughly. It provides a detailed discussion on the prevalent core-oriented and client-oriented attacks on blockchain technology and the vulnerabilities exploited by them. It also presents the possible countermeasure to these attacks. Moreover, it provides insight into the creation of a better version of the blockchain that is more suitable for different types of blockchain applications.",

  "title": "A hierarchical blockchain-based electricity market framework for energy transactions in a security-constrained cluster of microgrids",
  "abstract": "In this paper, a Hierarchical Blockchain-based electricity market framework is proposed for peer-to-peer energy transactions within and between Microgrids in a security-constrained cluster of Microgrids. This market enhances the energy transaction mechanism, market clearing process and security of the power market. The existing blockchain based electricity markets usually check the energy availability through a transaction verification process, however, the feasibility of energy transactions between microgrids from the power system point of view is not evaluated before approving a transaction and creating a new block. In this paper, the unique structure of the market makes it possible to consider reliability security constraints of the power grid during the transaction verification process. Furthermore, the blockchain ledger summarization and microgrid’s equivalent model development are other new features of this framework. To develop and verity this market framework, Java programming language is used to create the hierarchical blockchain-based algorithm, and a modified IEEE 37-bus distribution test feeder system is chosen as the case study. Numerical results will show the effectiveness of this market structure, especially, when several transactions are requested to transfer energy over some congested transmission corridors.",

  "title": "A novel group BWM approach to evaluate the implementation criteria of blockchain technology in the automotive industry supply chain",
  "abstract": "The use of blockchain technology leads to improved operations and supply chain (SC) integration. Moreover, identifying and evaluating the blockchain technology application criteria in the logistics system is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) challenge that requires taking into account the perspectives of experts with varying degrees of SC expertise. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel group decision-making method based on the best-worst method (BWM) to evaluate the criteria of implementing blockchain technology in the SC. The proposed approach provides a mechanism whereby opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are aggregated in nine steps, first. Then, weights of criteria are determined using BWM individual decision-making models. Moreover, two individual decision-making methods called nonlinear goal programming based BWM II (NGPBWM II) and linear goal programming based BWM II (LGPBWM II) are extended in this study, which can be adopted in both individual and group decision-making problems. The NGPBWM II and LGPBWM II methods can be used for both individual and group decision-making. This study proposes a novel group decision-making framework. The framework has fewer constraints than previous group BWM models and can consider different best (worst) criteria by different DMs. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated employing eight numerical examples. The results reveal the high accuracy of the NGPBWM II in all eight examples. Therefore, a combination of the proposed group decision-making method and NGPBWM II is applied in a real case to evaluate the application criteria of the blockchain technology in the automotive industry SC, which was a new application for using blockchain technology in SC.",

  "title": "How can the dynamic game be integrated into blockchain-based distributed energy resources multi-agent transactions for decision-making?",
  "abstract": "Distributed energy resources not only change the energy supply modes but also have great potential in energy transformation. There are some problems in distributed energy trading, such as high transaction frequency, small transaction volume, high operation cost, lack of information supervision and so on. The openness, transparency, tamper-proof and automatic execution of smart contracts of blockchain technology are consistent with the transaction demand of distributed energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-agent transaction model of distributed energy based on blockchain. First, the peer to peer transaction mode and transaction process are analysed. Second, a multi-agent dynamic Stackelberg game is launched. It takes distributed generation owners, energy storage companies and a grid corporation as leaders to conduct power bidding. Third, with consumers as followers, the time of use tariff bidding strategy was solved. The obtained results reveal that distributed energy resources are essential in the energy supply of carbon neutrality, which also determines the complementary relationship between a grid corporation and distributed generation owners. The two agents work together to exert effectiveness for the new power system. There is a large space for energy storage companies to improve, and consumers show a trend of off-peak power consumption.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based identity management and access control framework for open banking ecosystem",
  "abstract": "Financial institutions are following an open banking (OB) trend for service innovation and integration. OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.",

  "abstract": "In a complex and changing market environment, enterprises recognize the benefit of collaborating with their suppliers and B2B customers to minimize risks and increase the agility and efficiency of the overall supply chain. To ensure this collaboration, they are asked to share real-time data related to their activities (stock, capacity, etc.) and to collaborate with their partners to optimize operation management, to reduce costs and reach optimal service level. Therefore, they require robust and reliable IT platforms allowing partners to exchange sensitive information and guarantee transparency but also security. That explains the increasing interest among supply chain practitioners and academicians toward the blockchain technology thanks to what it promises in terms of security, transparency and automation. In this paper, we present initial steps of a study aiming to develop, test and deploy a supply chain collaboration platform using the blockchain technology. The purpose of our study is to present answers to many unsolved questions related to the ability of the blockchain technology to manage real scale supply chain data and maintain the promised advantages.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is the latest disruptive innovation. It is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency. However, the facts show that most cryptocurrencies are stuck in big issues such as scalability issues, resulting in longer transaction times. A two-layer solution was offered in previous studies to solve the scalability problem, but many issues emerged from this idea. Some of the 2 Layer proposals use the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol model, and some other studies use the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol model. In this study, the authors propose the Hybrid Lightning Protocol to solve the scalability problem of Blockchain networks by combining the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols without sharding. The author analyzes and designs the development of the Blockchain protocol based on previous research. This research is a Blockchain protocol model that can achieve a maximum throughput of around 1,668,000 transactions/second on a 2 Gbps Fiber network, which can reduce cryptocurrency volatility and shorten transaction times by solving scalability problems.",

  "abstract": "The upcoming development in vehicle to grid network (V2G) allows for the flow of energy from battery powered Electric Vehicle (EV) to grid as well as the exchange of information between them. However, during the information exchange, the EV’s confidential information should be transferred from one charging station to another in a secure manner. Furthermore, the anonymity of the EV and charging station should be preserved. Despite the fact that many works on anonymous authentication and privacy preservation exist, there is an increase in computational cost in existing surveys. In this work, the new charging station authenticates the EV using blockchain technology without the involvement of a trusted entity, resulting in a reduction in computational time. Moreover, an efficient revoking mechanism is suggested to block the misbehaving charging station from the V2G network. In addition, security analysis section proves the resistant of our work against several possible well known attacks. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the work, the simulation is performed using CYGWIN platform and the results are proved to be noteworthy.",

  "title": "Blockchain-Enabled decentralized Attribute-Based access control with policy hiding for smart healthcare",
  "abstract": "With the rapid development of edge computing technologies, smart healthcare significantly improves people’s lives by collecting and analyzing health data in real time. However, security and privacy issues impede the wide deployment of smart healthcare systems (SHS). Most of existing solutions still have drawbacks with respect to computation efficiency and users’ privacy. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled attribute-based access control scheme with hidden policies is proposed for SHS. The scheme introduces multiple authorities to avoid single point failure. Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users’ online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users’ sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.",

  "abstract": "Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) has promised to integrate multiple service providers to deliver a multimodal mobility service to commuters through a seamless digital platform. An efficient digital network architecture is imperative to achieve secure and reliable interactions among the involved parties. From the service provider’s perspective, Bby defining the mobility ownership for customers, MaaScan bring a personalized transport system to complement or even fully replace the concept of private vehicle ownership. This paper paves the initial steps to develop a distributed architecture to realize a MaaS digital network using blockchain technology. Therefore, a comprehensive blockchain-enabled MaaS platform with related industries is illustrated in this paper. To do so, first, we define crypto-tickets as means of ownership of the service and devise a straightforward smart contract to be executed in the blockchain network, which allows the customers to exchange the service ownership in a privacy-preserved manner. Then, we evaluate our blockchain-based ownership scheme’s efficacy against the traditional membership plans using a simplified simulation instance in MATLAB. Finally, we discuss the blockchain potentials in personalizing the ownership of the service, congestion management, and data trading between various stakeholder of a comprehensive MaaS platform.",

  "title": "Impact of Blockchain-IoE on economy",
  "abstract": "Blockchain is popular among the technologically inclined people looking to use the computer to send and receive data while paying attention to data safety and privacy concerns. Blockchains have the ability to maintain digital data, in its transparent form as well as unaltered one, with the help of distributed computing along with cryptography and hashing techniques. Such a blockchain technology, while incorporated with Supply Chain Management (SCM), is creating a huge impact on the economy. SCM is the technique to maintain the process transformation flow from the purchase of raw materials to the production of final products and plays a vital role in economy streamlining the business activities by aligning those with customer satisfaction while keeping an eye open to the competition. The significance of blockchain in the circular economy is more because it considers not only the business parameters but also the society and the environment too. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts are employed to ensure trustworthiness and reliability in the economy. Blockchain will still be more strengthened by integrating the recent technologies such as the internet of things and machine learning in economy-related applications. An optimal and neutral finance management system will be developed by the proper blending of the aforementioned technologies. The case studies of blockchain applications in various industrial fields, at various acceptance levels, and for various organizational purposes are discussed at the end of the chapter.",

  "title": "A novel insurance claim blockchain scheme based on zero-knowledge proof technology",
  "abstract": "It is crucial to ensure the privacy and authenticity of patients’ medical data in the medical insurance claim process, but in the current medical insurance claim process, there are some problems such as low efficiency, complex service, unreliable data and data leakage. Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients’ medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients’ identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat–Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients’ medical data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is feasible and has an acceptable time overhead.",

  "title": "Burn-to-Claim: An asset transfer protocol for blockchain interoperability",
  "abstract": "The future of multi-blockchain architecture depends on the emergence of new protocols that enable consensus between trustless cross-blockchain participants. However, interoperability between blockchains remains a research challenge. The existing interoperability approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, making it difficult to gain confidence in the security and correctness of the process. A cross-blockchain protocol must provide a self-verifiable state proof that encodes trust in the transfer process to guarantee consensus. Inspired by the burn-address concept, we propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-blockchain protocol to exchange assets between two networks. The proposed protocol transfers assets from one blockchain system to another so that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and recreated on the destination blockchain. Our protocol makes use of digital signatures, hash-time-locks and integration mechanisms to perform cross-blockchain transactions in a distributed manner. We theoretically prove that the proposed cross-blockchain protocol transfers assets securely and correctly. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the Burn-to-Claim protocol when used in an application environment.",

  "title": "Consortium blockchain-enabled smart ESG reporting platform with token-based incentives for corporate crowdsensing",
  "abstract": "Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues arouse wide concern in both industry and academia to promote sustainable development. Listed companies assume the responsibility to submit annual reports to disclose their ESG outcomes genuinely. However, the challenge is that companies may overstate or slur their actual sustainable performance, and the entire ESG reporting process is hidden backward, thereby making the report untrustworthy. Accordingly, this paper proposes an architecture of smart ESG reporting platform leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to enable corporate crowdsensing for environmental data and enhance the security, transparency and creditability of ESG reporting process. In addition, with the aim of motivating firms to upload massive ESG raw data of high quality, we devise an incentive mechanism that grants them crypto tokens as a reputation for sustainable performance disclosure, exposed to industry and investors for reference. The maximum tokens settlement for each environmental key performance indicator (KPI) is regarded as a cooperative game for premiums, and Shapley value is applied to fairly distribute the tokens in line with the disclosure significance scored by experienced investors. Here, we take the ESG reporting guide issued by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX) and the practice in the Hong Kong apparel industry as the context. An experimental simulation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform architecture and approach of token allocation. This study holds the promise of providing a precedent for adopting the advanced technologies to address the greenwashing in firms and actualize intelligent and trustable ESG reporting.",

  "title": "ABRIS: Anonymous blockchain based revocable and integrity preservation scheme for vehicle to grid network",
  "abstract": "The upcoming development in vehicle to grid network (V2G) allows for the flow of energy from battery powered Electric Vehicle (EV) to grid as well as the exchange of information between them. However, during the information exchange, the EV’s confidential information should be transferred from one charging station to another in a secure manner. Furthermore, the anonymity of the EV and charging station should be preserved. Despite the fact that many works on anonymous authentication and privacy preservation exist, there is an increase in computational cost in existing surveys. In this work, the new charging station authenticates the EV using blockchain technology without the involvement of a trusted entity, resulting in a reduction in computational time. Moreover, an efficient revoking mechanism is suggested to block the misbehaving charging station from the V2G network. In addition, security analysis section proves the resistant of our work against several possible well known attacks. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the work, the simulation is performed using CYGWIN platform and the results are proved to be noteworthy.",

  "title": "Hybrid lightning protocol: An approach for blockchain scalability issue",
  "abstract": "Blockchain is the latest disruptive innovation. It is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency. However, the facts show that most cryptocurrencies are stuck in big issues such as scalability issues, resulting in longer transaction times. A two-layer solution was offered in previous studies to solve the scalability problem, but many issues emerged from this idea. Some of the 2 Layer proposals use the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol model, and some other studies use the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol model. In this study, the authors propose the Hybrid Lightning Protocol to solve the scalability problem of Blockchain networks by combining the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols without sharding. The author analyzes and designs the development of the Blockchain protocol based on previous research. This research is a Blockchain protocol model that can achieve a maximum throughput of around 1,668,000 transactions/second on a 2 Gbps Fiber network, which can reduce cryptocurrency volatility and shorten transaction times by solving scalability problems.",

Triggering condition of smart contract is the information outside the blockchain, and thus an oracle is required to provide the data services. For the security of user funds in on-chain aggregation model, each oracle must pay the gas fees to transmit off-chain data to the blockchain and trigger the smart contract, but this way easily causes the network congestion. In view of this, we propose an elliptic curve threshold signature scheme for blockchain (BC-ECTSS) to overcome the above issue. In the random oracle (RO) model, we detailedly show BC-ECTSS satisfies the existential unforgeability against the adaptive chosen-message attacks; in addition, it has the anonymity and its computation cost is relatively low.",

  "title": "An efficient video watermark method using blockchain",
  "abstract": "Nowadays, one of the most common approaches for video watermarking is to use singular value decomposition in the discrete wavelet transform domain. In our prior work, we formulated a video watermarking problem to achieve the maximum peak signal to noise ratio as an optimization problem. It chooses wavelet coefficient points in key frames with minimum distortion cost. Yet the existing solution has two drawbacks (1) it requires to store a large number of coordinates depending on the watermark size; (2) it is vulnerable to video frame attacks on the video frame texture area. To avoid them, this paper proposes a blockchain-based approach. Its main concept is to choose wavelet coefficient blocks in key frames and leverage blockchain to connect all the blocks. Our experimental results show that this approach is memory efficient because it only requires to store a single key for a key frame, which is independent of the watermark size; and the overall robustness is greatly improved due to the randomness of the hash function used in the blockchain. Hence, this work had made novel and significant contributions to the field of video watermarking.",

  "abstract": "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain. All historical Bitcoin transactions are stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, but Bitcoin owners are generally unknown. This is the reason for Bitcoin's pseudo-anonymity, therefore it is often used for illegal transactions. Bitcoin addresses are related to Bitcoin users' identities. Some Bitcoin addresses have the potential to be analyzed due to the behavior patterns of Bitcoin transactions. However, existing Bitcoin analysis methods do not consider the fusion of new blocks' data, resulting in low efficiency of Bitcoin address analysis. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes an incremental Bitcoin address cluster method to avoid re-clustering when new block data is added. Besides, a heuristic Bitcoin address clustering algorithm is developed to improve clustering accuracy for the Bitcoin Blockchain. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases Bitcoin address cluster efficiency and accuracy.",

Thus, in the last decade, many solutions have been proposed to improve the propagation of blocks. Motivated by SRRS (social reinforcement rumor spreading), we propose a blockchain fast propagation protocol named SRRS protocol based on a non-Markovian process, where the verification and transmission of a block depend on its propagation history. The simulated experimental results show that our protocol can significantly accelerate the propagation of blocks. Compared with existing major solutions, our protocol does not change the main procedure of Bitcoin and the block data structure, which is a huge advantage for practical applications. Moreover, employing the theories of complex networks and percolation, we develop a method of theoretical analysis, which can find the optimal setting of our protocol.",

  "title": "Blockchain adoption in a supply chain system to combat counterfeiting",
  "abstract": "The ongoing boom in platform retailing has been accompanied by widespread counterfeiting. Blockchain technology has attracted much attention as a way to combat this practice. We consider a supply chain system consisting of one brand seller, one counterfeiter and one platform retailer and examine how blockchain adoption affects the decisions of firms in this system and the performance of the whole system. We show that the platform’s use of blockchain reduces both products’ selling price and increases the brand seller’s demand while also increasing the counterfeiter’s demand under certain conditions when a wholesale contract is adopted. Moreover, we find that blockchain technology could be an effective anticounterfeit tool but that the platform does not always use it, even if its implementation is costless. The platform is more willing to use blockchain when imitation good’s quality is relatively low, and an agency contract can better incentivize the platform to deploy blockchain than a wholesale contract if the commission fee is large. Finally, consumer surplus and social welfare may decrease after the platform adopts blockchain, but the whole supply chain system can perform better through the platform’s blockchain implementation if the imitation good’s quality and consumers’ trust in the platform are low.",

  "title": "Research on significant factors affecting adoption of blockchain technology for enterprise distributed applications based on integrated MCDM FCEM-MULTIMOORA-FG method",
  "abstract": "Blockchain technology-powered applications infuse trust in the system without intermediary entities. Researchers’ interest in blockchain technology has increased dramatically in recent years as a result of this distinguishing feature. However, the adoption of this novel paradigm in enterprise distributed applications is not very encouraging. To adopt a new technology in an industry, managers and technocrats have to do multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in a fuzzy environment. The aim of this study is to propose a system model for the identification and monitoring of significant factors responsible for the slow adoption rate of blockchain technology. In this research, the MULTIMOORA method for group decision-making, a popular MCDM approach, has been further extended by integrating the information entropy weight–fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model (IEW-FCEM) for an uncertain environment. The proposed method of FCEM-MULTIMOORA-FG combines the benefits of four best-in-class ranking methods, namely, the fuzzy ratio system, the fuzzy reference point method, the fuzzy full multiplicative form, and the IEW-FCEM. The idea behind integrating the IEW-FCEM with MULTIMOORA-FG is that information entropy will derive the objective weights of the criteria, thus removing the dependency upon subject matter expert experience only. An empirical study demonstrates the efficacy and practicability of the FCEM-MULTIMOORA-FG method. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally straightforward with better position accuracy than previous algorithms and that its basic idea is logical and understandable, making it easier to apply in a computer system. Additionally, a comparative analysis with five more MCDM methods was executed to validate the results.",

  "title": "Estimation of the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network",
  "abstract": "Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today’s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.",

  "abstract": "The targeted advertising is based on preference profiles inferred via relationships among individuals, their monitored responses to previous advertising and temporal activity over the Internet, which has raised critical privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a novel proposal for a Blockchain-based advertising platform that provides: a system for privacy preserving user profiling, privately requesting ads from the advertising system, the billing mechanisms for presented and clicked ads, the advertising system that uploads ads to the cloud according to profiling interests, various types of transactions to enable advertising operations in Blockchain-based network, and the method that allows a cloud system to privately compute the access policies for various resources (such as ads, mobile user profiles). Our main goal is to design a decentralised framework for targeted ads, which enables private delivery of ads to users whose behavioural profiles accurately match the presented ads, defined by the ad system. We implement a POC of our proposed framework i.e. a Bespoke Miner and experimentally evaluate various components of Blockchain-based in-app advertising system, implementing various critical components; such as, evaluating user profiles, implementing access policies, encryption and decryption of users’ profiles. We observe that the processing delay for traversing policies of various tree sizes, the encryption/decryption time of user profiling with various key-sizes and user profiles of various interests evaluates to an acceptable amount of processing time as that of the currently implemented ad systems.",

  "title": "Blockchain and homomorphic encryption based privacy-preserving model aggregation for medical images",
  "abstract": "Medical healthcare centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data for COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and training models within a single organization. This practice can be considered a weakness as it leads to several privacy and security concerns related to raw data communication. To overcome this weakness and secure raw data communication, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides a solution for collaborative data training. The proposed framework enables the coordination of multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models while preserving data privacy. Blockchain ledger technology provides decentralization of federated learning models without relying on a central server. Moreover, the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of the model to preserve privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: (i) train the local model by a novel capsule network for segmentation and classification of COVID-19 images, (ii) furthermore, we use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, (iii) finally, the model is shared over a decentralized platform through the proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing over the decentralized network. To validate our proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.",

  "title": "Impact on blockchain-based AI/ML-enabled big data analytics for Cognitive Internet of Things environment",
  "abstract": "Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) supports the organizations to learn from the information (data) arriving from various connected devices, sensors, machines and other sources, and at the same time it inspires intelligence into different business operations, products, customer experiences, and people. Data poising attacks are very serious concerns because they may play a significant factor for businesses and organizations for both financial terms and damaging their reputations, when the Big data analytics on the analyzed data is itself corrupted. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we suggest a blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence(AI)/Machine Learning(ML)-enabled Big data analytics mechanism for CIoT environment. The comprehensive experimental results have been provided under two circumstances: (1) performance of the ML model under data poisoning attacks and (2) performance of the ML model without data poisoning attacks. In the first case, we show how the data poison attacks can effect the ML model when the data is on some cloud storage (i.e. not in the blockchains), whereas in the second case we show the effect when the data is in the blockchains (i.e., without data poisoning attacks). The experimental results demonstrate that we have significant gains in performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score when there are no data poisoning attacks on the data. Moreover, a detailed blockchain simulation has carried out to demonstrate the practical aspects of the proposed security framework.",

  "title": "Applying blockchain-based method to smart contract classification for CPS applications",
  "abstract": "Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing researches on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of codes with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls are found in this paper.",

  "abstract": "Migration (irregular and forced) represents one of the major challenges the international community faces today. Inasmuch as the phenomenon of irregular and forced migration is the marker of the state of socio-economic systems around the world, the response to and the ways of navigating the resulting multi-scalar challenges mirror not only the efficiency of the global regulatory frameworks, but also our civility. Recognizing the potential inherent in sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT), specifically the blockchain technology and smart contracts, this paper focuses on the special case of “welcome centers” that irregular migrants enter in the hope of acquiring international legal protection and thus refugee status. Since the process may be time-consuming and the living conditions undignified, this paper proposes a tool, named here “responsible wallet”, aka rWallet, that bears the promise of navigating some of these challenges. rWallet derives from the recognition that in modern societies ICT should serve the purpose of improving the quality of life of all people.",

  "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to examine how blockchain and in general distributed. ledger technology can help to solve intellectual property challenges of today´s era of digitization. We investigate business ventures leveraging blockchain technology to manage the intellectual property life cycle, in other words how intellectual properties are created, protected, managed and monetized. Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria. Our goal is to understand which intellectual property challenges distributed ledger technology is trying to solve and how. We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.",

  "title": "How does the retailing industry decide the best replenishment strategy by utilizing technological support through blockchain?",
  "abstract": "Practitioners face two significant issues: product inaccuracy and transparency in supply chain management. Blockchain is a highly secure and trustworthy means of storing data. Radio frequency identification incorporation is essential if reliability is at a low level. Incorporating radio frequency identification can improve supply chain management in terms of product's visibility for the best replenishment strategy. A production and replenishment coordination via mathematical modeling is visualized through a three-echelon supply chain with a non-reliable production process, and the retailer deals with misplacement issues. The manufacturer handles the inventory flowing reversely and is responsible for proper end-of-life treatment, either repairing or remanufacturing. Repairs are sold in bulk on the secondary market, and remanufactured items are used to prevent retailers' shortages. In this model, radio frequency identification technology on the physical surface is combined with a blockchain on the cyber surface, containing all the information about the product, including its location and attributes. A comparative study is provided for the traditional supply chain with misplacement versus a blockchain-based supply chain with radio frequency identification. An analytical approach is used to arrive at the optimum policy for the practitioners, and numerical analysis illustrates the problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the technology is highly profitable for supply chain management. Radio frequency identification technology can increase profit by up to 61%. After discrepancy, holding cost is the second most sensitive parameter for the profit function. If the holding cost is higher, profit can be increased by 40% using radio frequency identification and blockchain. The negative effect of misplacement is reduced with an increasing demand rate, but the reduction rate is very slow. The choice of not adopting radio frequency identification can only be successful if demand is so high that it can reduce the effect of misplacement.",

  "title": "A blockchain-based reputation system for trusted VANET nodes",
  "abstract": "Vehicular network applications, such as Local Danger Warnings (LDW), have become necessary as they provide services to drivers with warnings and instructions to ensure safe driving. However, before any vehicle reacts to an alert, it is essential to verify its veracity because an incorrect warning misleads other vehicles and causes unnecessary delays and detours in traffic. On the other hand, ignoring an alert or taking too long to verify it can cause accidents. A common way to address this problem is via a reputation system, where the veracity and plausibility of an alert message are assessed based on the reputation of the vehicle that discloses it. This paper describes a decentralized reputation system based on a consortium blockchain and smart contracts called BRS4VANETs. This system analyzes the reliability of data generated by a vehicle, detects malicious behavior, and contributes to decision-making. The complete functional architecture of the system, detailing the algorithms, evaluation metrics, communication protocol, and message formats, is described and implemented. Experiments with network and traffic simulators evaluated the risk of a false message attack, the effectiveness of the system and its overheads. The assessment demonstrates the importance of reputation systems and also shows the feasibility of having a decentralized system to store and disseminate reputation information based on blockchain technologies. Finally, the results also demonstrate that BRS4VANETs can successfully detect suspicious and malicious vehicles.",

  "abstract": "IoMT technology has many advantages in healthcare system, such as optimizing the medical service model, improving the efficiency of hospital operation and management, and improving the overall service level of the hospital. IoMT devices do not have a security authentication mechanism, and the trust between devices relies heavily on centralized third-party services. Blockchain can provide a secure interactive environment for the medical Internet of Things. However, security issues in the IoMT-Blockchain environment are also becoming increasingly prominent. Cyber-attacks targeting IoMT-Blockchain will not only compromise the security of IoT devices, but also seriously affect the security of the Internet. Therefore, how to detect abnormal traffic in the IoMT-Blockchain environment becomes particularly important. In this work, an abnormal traffic detection with deep neural network is designed for abnormal traffic detection in IoMT-Blockchain environment. First, this work proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on multi-model autoencoders. The algorithm processes the feature information in groups to reduce the complexity between traffic feature information. It builds a multi-model autoencoder to further extract fusion features between multi-model features. Second, to maximize use of traffic data information in detection network, this work proposes a multi-feature sequence anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm extracts low-level fusion features and high-level temporal features in network traffic respectively, and applies the features to anomaly detection and classification tasks by means of residual learning.",

  "title": "A survey on blockchain-enabled federated learning and its prospects with digital twin",
  "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) supports real time analysis and provides a reliable simulation platform in the Internet of Things (IoT). The creation and application of DT hinges on amounts of data, which poses pressure on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for DT descriptions and intelligent decision-making. Federated Learning (FL) is a cutting-edge technology that enables geographically dispersed devices to collaboratively train a shared global model locally rather than relying on a data center to perform model training. Therefore, DT can benefit by combining with FL, successfully solving the ”data island” problem in traditional AI. However, FL still faces serious challenges, such as enduring single-point failures, suffering from poison attacks, lacking effective incentive mechanisms. Before the successful deployment of DT, we should tackle the issues caused by FL. Researchers from industry and academia have recognized the potential of introducing Blockchain Technology (BT) into FL to overcome the challenges faced by FL, where BT acting as a distributed and immutable ledger, can store data in a secure, traceable, and trusted manner. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive literature review on this topic is still missing. In this paper, we review existing works about blockchain-enabled FL and visualize their prospects with DT. To this end, we first propose evaluation requirements with respect to security, fault-tolerance, fairness, efficiency, cost-saving, profitability, and support for heterogeneity. Then, we classify existing literature according to the functionalities of BT in FL and analyze their advantages and disadvantages based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Finally, we discuss open problems in the existing literature and the future of DT supported by blockchain-enabled FL, based on which we further propose some directions for future research.",

  "abstract": "The modern digitalization trends have totally transformed business practices and business models. Blockchain as a distributed technology makes possible the basic structure of a database with a combination of data blocks and hash chains. Using distributed software architecture and advanced computation, blockchain might change the method of data exchange among chain actors. Blockchain causes administration of a network in peer-to-peer and decentralized form; and influences the way of data exchange and interactions in organizations; hence, this study looks for evaluation of the impact of blockchain technology on corporate performance and governance of new firms. In the first section of the study, the research conceptual model was extracted by means of the previous studies and the hypotheses were formulated. In the second section, the relationships between the variables of the model among newly-established active business were assessed. The statistical population of the study was managers of SMEs in Iran and 397 completed questionnaires were received. Structural equation model and Smart PLS software have been used for data analysis. The research findings showed that the more the blockchain adoption in a new firm; the more direct effect it would have on the firm's performance. Similarly, corporate governance has an effect on the relationship of blockchain technology on corporate performance. Thus, managers of new firms by means of blockchain, can prepare the grounds for good corporate governance as well as the achievement of better performance.",

  "abstract": "With the rapid increasing number of applications using blockchain, how to improve the throughput of business and reduce the latency of committing transaction on the blockchain have become important topics. This article proposes an elastic batched byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol whose name is EB-BFT, which elastically changing consensus nodes participating in the consensus and scaling the number of transactions batching in the consensus based on volume of the transaction as well as the physical resources. The protocol EB-BFT first identifies low-performance nodes and suspends them from participating in consensus, so the number of consensus nodes is dynamically changed. After validate the legality of transactions sent by clients, the algorithm of dynamically scaling the number of batched transactions in consensus is proposed. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of EB-BFT in terms of throughput and latency, and it proves when the upper limit of the latency of committing transactions is set at 15 s, the dealing speed of business can reach 20000 transactions per seconds, this results proves that this protocol will make the blockchain having better performance in larger throughput and shorter latency of processing transactions, which also proves that our method can handle transactions as well as traditional centralized system.",

  "title": "Cross-domain identity authentication scheme based on blockchain and PKI system",
  "abstract": "In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the cross-domain identity authentication of users is very important for the development of VANET due to the large cross-domain mobility of vehicle users. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system is often used to solve the identity authentication and security trust problems faced by VANET. However, the PKI system has challenges such as too centralized Authority of Certification Authority (CA), frequent cross-domain access to certificate interactions and high authentication volume, leading to high certificate management costs, complex cross-domain authentication paths, easy privacy leakage, and overburdened networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based PKI identity management and authentication architecture that uses smart contracts to reduce the heavy burden caused by CAs directly managing the life cycle of digital certificates. On this basis, a trust chain based on smart contracts is designed to replace the traditional CA trust chain to meet the general cross-domain requirements, to effectively avoid the communication pressure caused by a mass of certificate transmissions. For the cross-domain scenario with higher privacy and security requirements the identity attribute authentication service is provided directly while protecting privacy by using the Merkle tree to anchor identity attribute data on and off the blockchain chain. Finally, the proposed scheme was comprehensively analyzed in terms of cost, time consumption and security.",

  "abstract": "Credit data barriers, such as incomplete credit records, false credit information, and low security of credit data, exist in the supply chain financial credit system, rendering it difficult to support the closure of the whole financing chain's credit system. Emerging blockchain technology can help improve credit-reporting ability through greater integrity, decentralization, transparency, security, and reliability. Aiming to address the problem of extensive credit investigation data and privacy protection, we propose a blockchain-based model to realize access control and management of the shared transaction information in the supply chain. Our model adopts a consensus mechanism to solve the problem of large credit investigation data and privacy protection of credit investigation data and realizes access control and management of the shared data chain. In our model, data are stored on the cloud server and shared with the proxy reencryption method. The model's data structure and workflow are designed to facilitate specific applications in supply chain finance. The embedded blockchain technology helps build the open shared reference architecture and establish the entire life cycle of a monitoring mechanism. The existing blockchain consensus mechanism has low security and a large resource consumption; as such, it is particularly important to design a new consensus mechanism to serve the credit investigation system. In this study, blockchain data sharing and traceability can be realized by improving the consensus mechanism, helping to improve the existing credit investigation service system. Our findings help optimize the existing supply chain financial credit system and enhance the efficiency of supply chain financing.",

Firstly, we present Heterogeneity Considered Trust Mechanism (HCTM) for IoT nodes, which evaluates the trust value according to capacity and quality, and makes the trust evaluation more reasonable. Then, we present Trust based Time-Constrained PoW (TBTC-PoW). We allocate reasonable time windows to the consensus nodes according to the computing resources, trust values and mining difficulty, which reduces the energy consumption and improves the security of PoW. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our method has a lower energy consumption and higher security.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based donations traceability framework",
  "abstract": "The rapid growth of modern technologies has encouraged non-profit organizations (NPOs) to harness such technologies to better serve the charity sector, especially in relation to charity donation processes. Non-profit organizations primarily rely on fundraising that may involve opaque operations, which leads to the exacerbation of fears that donations may be used for illegal purposes or not reach deserving people. The necessity of charity donations traceability system is inevitable to overcome such concerns, which have an adverse impact on doners’ trust in the donation process. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based donation traceability framework intended to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients. The system is built on a public-permissioned blockchain on the Ethereum platform, with every transaction being recorded as a block in the chain. These blocks of information are immutable and visible to all parties, and they also enable timely and traceable transactions. The proposed framework’s effectiveness is evaluated using a hybrid qualitative approach and proves to improve the traceability of charity donations overcoming the uncertainty associated with current systems.",

  "abstract": "Supply chains have often benefited from breakthroughs in information technology. Blockchain, in particular, is a recent technology that is promising to revolutionize the way supply chains are designed and operated. This paper proposes a framework to optimize the adoption of blockchain jointly with the design of the supply chain network. A new form of product differentiation is enabled through blockchain adoption where blockchain-certified products are sold at a premium price to a growing segment of customers. The proposed framework allows supply chain managers to monetize data which has traditionally been used to improve supply chain efficiency. The framework is evaluated using a realistic case study inspired by the global supply chain of fresh-cut flowers. The results show that by strategically using blockchain at certain locations in the supply chain network, significant cost savings are realized compared to fully deploying blockchain throughout the supply chain. These cost savings lead to increased demand, better consumer surplus, and higher supply chain profit. Furthermore, the proposed data-enabled product differentiation leads to fresher products in the market.",

However, public access to collected heterogeneous IoT urban data is more vulnerable to hackers invading intellectual property as all devices are connected to the internet. IoT security plays a vital role in the smart city. This IoT security is a real challenge as multiple goals and major inconveniences slow the rapid adaption of these smart devices. This paper presents a permissioned-based blockchain system that uses the arbiter PUF model to secure the key pairs of IoT devices using lightweight technology. A collaborative detection system is initially used to detect the DDoS on IoT devices using the machine learning-based ensemble technique, which provides a lower false-positive rate and better detection rate than the other classification technique. Next, we incorporated the blockchain system that securely shares the alarm alerts to all the nodes of the IoT network with adequately secured authentication.",

  "title": "A Blockchain-Based Life-Cycle Environmental Management Framework for Hospitals in the COVID-19 Context",
  "abstract": "During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, many hospitals were built or renovated around the world to meet the challenges posed by the rising number of infected cases. Environmental management in the hospital life cycle is vital in preventing nosocomial infection and includes many infection control procedures. In certain urgent situations, a hospital must be completed quickly, and work process approval and supervision must therefore be accelerated. Thus, many works cannot be checked in detail. This results in a lack of work liability control and increases the difficulty of ensuring the fulfillment of key infection prevention measures. This study investigates how blockchain technology can transform the work quality inspection workflow to assist in nosocomial infection control under a fast delivery requirement. A blockchain-based life-cycle environmental management framework is proposed to track the fulfillment of crucial infection control measures in the design, construction, and operation stages of hospitals. The proposed framework allows for work quality checking after the work is completed, when some work cannot be checked on time. Illustrative use cases are selected to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed solution. This study provides new insights into applying blockchain technology to address the challenge of environmental management brought by rapid delivery requirements.",

  "title": "Traceability vs. sustainability in supply chains: The implications of blockchain",
  "abstract": "This research proposes a game theory model in a supply chain (SC) involving one manufacturer and one retailer. The SC works in a global market in which consumers are located worldwide and subject to traceability issues that can create distrust of the product quality. This issue can be resolved by implementing blockchain technology which provides benefits in terms of high traceability along with low transaction costs. However, blockchain negatively impacts the environment because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, we capture the trade-offs between traceability and sustainability for blockchain adoption by characterizing a game theory model. Our findings show that high levels of distrust pushes firms to avoid the implementation of blockchain. In such circumstances, blockchain is not sufficient to make consumers recognize the product quality and trust the firms’ practices. In contrast, low levels of distrust can make blockchain an economically suitable technology conditioned to minimal environmental damages; otherwise, firms need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between distrust and sustainability. Since the adoption of blockchain leads to an increase in prices and decrease of distrust, two factors determine whether to pursue this technology or not: low consumer sensitivity to price and high sensitivity to quality. In this study, we develop three specific cases where we model: 1) the direct impact of blockchain on distrust, 2) a stochastic distrust term, and 3) a Stackelberg game. Each case confirms our results and strengthens the robustness of our findings.",

  "title": "A blockchain-orchestrated deep learning approach for secure data transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system",
  "abstract": "The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with traditional healthcare systems has improved quality of healthcare services. However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.",

  "title": "RouteChain: Towards Blockchain-based secure and efficient BGP routing",
  "abstract": "Routing on the Internet is defined among autonomous systems (ASes) based on a weak trust model where it is assumed that ASes are honest. While this trust model strengthens the connectivity among ASes, it also results in an attack surface that can be exploited to hijack the routing paths. One such attack is known as the BGP prefix hijacking, in which a malicious AS broadcasts IP prefixes that belong to a target AS, thereby hijacking its traffic. In this paper, we propose RouteChain: a blockchain-based secure BGP routing system that counters BGP hijacking and maintains a consistent view of the Internet routing paths. Towards that, we leverage provenance assurance and tamper-proof properties of blockchains to augment trust among ASes. We group ASes based on their geographical (network) proximity and construct a bi-hierarchical blockchain model that detects false prefixes prior to their spread over the Internet. We evaluate RouteChain using three different consensus protocols and show its effectiveness by drawing a case study with the Youtube hijacking of 2008. Our results show that RouteChain can efficiently detect false prefix announcements and prevent BGP attacks over the Internet.",

  "title": "Sec-edge: Trusted blockchain system for enabling the identification and authentication of edge based 5G networks",
  "abstract": "The 5th generation 5G technology, also known as the 2020 telecommunications system, represents the next exciting phase of the evolution of telecommunications, with the recent successful distribution on nearly every continent. 5G is believed to bring multiple advancements such as greater transmission speeds, ultra-low latency, higher network capacity, etc. These advancements will directly support the industry-5.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) in the coming future. Today, IoT is one of the fastest-growing technologies because of its ability to deliver multiple applications across various devices. The emergence of 5G networks will be a major force for IoT development. Subsequently, Edge computing as an extension of cloud computing has emerged as a promising technology to empower 5G and IoT services due to its close vicinity to IoT Devices. However, specific challenging issues plague the integration of 5G, IoT, and Edge Computing, among which security is one of the biggest concerns. Recently, blockchain has been provided as a foundational and decentralized distributed ledger technology that can be used for solving the challenges of IoT, 5G, and Edge Computing integration. This paper proposes a trusted blockchain system for edge-based 5G networks that eliminates the limitations of integrating the Edge Computing, IoT, and 5G networks. The proposed blockchain system can efficiently identify the edge devices, authenticate the devices, and assign the addresses to the edge devices on a demand basis. Further, the proposed work also provides the secure communication among the edge devices that can protect from DDOS and Side-channel attacks.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain is an unprecedented enabler and booster of business process innovation, especially in the healthcare sector. Nonetheless, its transformational potential has yet to be fully harnessed because of the challenges that digitalization has posed to Business Process Management (BPM) and the inherent complexity of the healthcare processes. Accordingly, through the ambidextrous BPM theoretical lenses, this paper investigates what are the main opportunities for Blockchain-driven healthcare process innovation and which BPM capabilities may unleash them. Two exploratory case studies were conducted to probe the Blockchain-driven process redesign: a case of exploitative BPM, focusing on drug logistics, and a case of explorative BPM, focusing on integrated home care. Our findings suggest that Blockchain may enable Healthcare innovation opportunities, such as the redesign of the information flow and the development of new forms of collaboration in the health ecosystem. In addition, the most relevant BPM capabilities to pursue such innovations were identified. These results integrate the BPM research stream and enhance the understanding of Blockchain-driven healthcare process innovation.",

Our work focuses on industrial applications of blockchains and not on cryptocurrencies or tokens. We use frameworks to compare public and permissioned blockchains specifically suited for industrial applications. We also propose a complete solution based on Ethereum to implement a decentralized application, putting together in an original way, components and patterns already used and proven. This solution is characterized by a set of validator nodes running the blockchain using Proof-of-Authority or similar efficient consensus algorithms, by the use of an explorer enabling users to check the blockchain state, and the source code of the smart contracts running on it. From time to time, the hash digest of the last mined block is written into a public blockchain to guarantee immutability. The right to send transactions is granted by validator nodes to users by endowing them with the Ethers mined locally. Overall, the proposed approach has the same transparency and immutability as a public blockchain, largely reducing its drawbacks.",

  "title": "A reinforcement learning model for the reliability of blockchain oracles",
  "abstract": "Smart contracts struggle with the major limitation of operating on data that is solely residing on the blockchain network. The need of recruiting third parties, known as oracles, to assist smart contracts has been recognized with the emergence of blockchain technology. Oracles could be deviant and commit ill-intentioned behaviors, or be selfish and hide their actual available resources to gain optimal profit. Current research proposals employ oracles as trusted entities with no robust assessment mechanism, which entails a risk of turning them into centralized points of failure. The need for an effective method to select the most economical and rewarding oracles that are self-interested and act independently is somehow neglected. Thus, this paper proposes a Bayesian Bandit Learning Oracles Reliability (BLOR) mechanism to identify trustless and cost-efficient oracles. Within BLOR, we learn the behavior of oracles by formulating a Bayesian cost-dependent reputation model and utilize reinforcement learning (knowledge gradient algorithm) to guide the learning process. BLOR enables all the blockchain validators to verify the obtained results while running the algorithm at the same time by dealing with the randomness issue within the limited blockchain structure. We implement and experiment with BLOR using Python and the Solidity language on Ethereum. BLOR is benchmarked against several models where it proved to be highly efficient in selecting the most reliable and economical oracles with a fair balance.",

  "title": "Energy storage capacity competition-based demand response method in blockchain ancillary service market",
  "abstract": "With the development of new energy, the ancillary service demand of power grid is increasing. The published literature focuses on building a blockchain ancillary service market to ensure the safety and efficiency of ancillary service transactions. However, due to the high threshold and poor scalability, the existing blockchain market is hard to meet the demand of the response rate of ancillary services. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy storage capacity competition-based demand response method in blockchain ancillary service market. Firstly, a new market structure is proposed, which uses the Proof of Capacity (POC) as the consensus mechanism. The structure uses POC to realize the competition among users’ energy storage capacity. Secondly, the demand response process of ancillary service market is designed. During the transaction processes, the probability of users participating in the transaction is changed according to the users’ storage capacity. Dealing with different demands, the market chooses the user with the largest capacity or the combination of users to respond. The simulation shows that, compared with the traditional ancillary service market, the capacity competition-based market demand response rate is increased by 20%, the time to fulling all users’ capacity in the market is reduced by 2 h, and the call rate of user’s capacity is increased by 10%.",

  "title": "Leveraging blockchain concepts as watermarkers of plastics for sustainable waste management in progressing circular economy",
  "abstract": "Blockchain-integrated waste management and circular economy are emergent concepts that target minimising waste generation and fluctuations of resource commodity. Blockchain can support a circular economy and green principles by enabling information transparency, reliability and automation. Redesigning plastics by molecular tagging is the way forward to ensure synthetic plastics are kept in an infinite loop and support closed-loop recycling. The involvement of major corporations in product development and blockchain-integrated closed-loop recycling has resulted in several successful green chemical approaches toward circular plastic economy projects. Government policies and legislations are progressively supporting plastic redesigning for improving the plastic circular economy. Nevertheless, a systematic approach is required in addressing blockchain technology and plastic redesigning to effectively leverage circular economy initiatives.",

  "title": "Blockchain based Scalable model for Secure Dynamic Spectrum Access",
  "abstract": "Conventional Cooperative spectrum sensing techniques either suffer from single point of failure attack or lack in providing incentives to users which makes them incompatible for Wireless Service Provider (WSP). We propose a dynamic spectrum access framework for WSP which gives prominence to automated sensing and sharing with the use of blockchain. In this system, the opportunity of spectrum access is first examined by sensor nodes and the access right is then allocated to the users when their transactions to WSP are authenticated in a decentralized manner. Apart from using blockchain as a reliable platform for automatic enforcement of spectrum sensing, we propose a novel mechanism for securing our network from the threats designed primarily for Cognitive Radio Networks. In addition to this, our proposed approach enhances the scalability of blockchain networks by using the sidechains for storing data and checkpointing it onto main chain after periodic intervals of time. Extensive simulations in Octave indicate superior performance offered by our proposed model.",

  "abstract": "With increasing uncertainties in the global economy, companies are facing fierce competition. Blockchain has the potential to enhance companies’ competitiveness by streamlining processes, improving productivity and reducing costs. It is meaningful to study whether and when companies would adopt blockchain and under what conditions. We develop a game theoretic model to analyse the introduction of blockchain to companies from a big customer with bargaining power. In this study, ship operators need to decide their optimal adoption time when facing a request from a big shipper to adopt blockchain with a threat of substitution policy from the shipper. An algorithm is developed to obtain the numerical solutions of ship operators’ optimal adoption time. Our analysis suggests that 1) the substitution policy only matters to small companies and is only necessary under fixed pricing model; 2) a threshold applies for substitution ratio and cut-off time to effectively induce small companies to adopt blockchain early; 3) blockchain developers should consider mixed pricing model instead of fixed pricing model for faster and wider blockchain adoption; 4) blockchain initiators should focus more on improving the technology’s cost-effectiveness rather than rely heavily on externalities like substitution policies to promote blockchain adoption.",

  "abstract": "Data dissemination of safety messages in smart transportation allows vehicles to broadcast safety-related information about their surroundings to other vehicles within their proximity for early warnings of endangering events. Safety can only be achieved if the data transmitted are reliable. However, this may violate the privacy of a vehicle. At the same time, malicious or defective vehicles should be held accountable when misbehavior occurs. Utilizing blockchain technology, we propose a secure data dissemination scheme for smart transportation that solves the conflicting security requirements of reliability, privacy and accountability simultaneously, which provides a desirable level of security through its decentralized system. The analysis evaluation and simulation experiments signify our proposed scheme achieves security and performance efficiency, robust against adversarial attacks and practical for real world deployment.",

  "title": "T2L: A traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics",
  "abstract": "Traceability and trustiness are two critical issues in the logistics sector. Blockchain provides a potential way for logistics tracking systems due to its traits of tamper resistance. However, it is non-trivial to apply blockchain on logistics because of firstly, the binding relationship between virtue data and physical location cannot be guaranteed so that frauds may exist. Secondly, it is neither practical to upload complete data on the blockchain due to the limited storage resources nor convincing to trust the digest of the data. This paper proposes a traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics T2L to provide an efficient solution to the mentioned problems. Specifically, the authenticated geocoding data from telecom operators’ base stations are adopted to ensure the location credibility of the data before being uploaded to the blockchain for the purpose of reliable traceability of the logistics. Moreover, we propose a scheme based on Zero Knowledge Proof of Retrievability (ZK BLS-PoR) to ensure the trustiness of the data digest and the proofs to the blockchain. Any user in the system can check the data completeness by verifying the proofs instead of downloading and examining the whole data based on the proposed ZK BLS- PoR scheme, which can provide solid theoretical verification. In all, the proposed T2L framework is a traceable and trustable logistics system with a high level of security.",

  "title": "Blockchain-empowered secure federated learning system: Architecture and applications",
  "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to realize distributed machine learning on heterogeneous clients without exposing their private data. However, there is the risk of single point failure with FL because it relies on a central server to gather the model updates from clients, moreover, malicious behaviors of some clients may lead to low-quality or even poisoned global models. Blockchain as a revolutionary distributed ledger technology can alleviate the above problems to significantly enhance the security and scalability of FL systems. Therefore, this article presents a general framework of Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BFL) system with detailed description of its key technologies and operation steps. We then review and compare the most recent representative BFL applications. And we outlook some key challenges and opportunities of the future BFL system in terms of security, cost, and scalability. Finally, we propose PoS-BFL in IoT scenarios with malicious devices. The validator voting mechanism and role switching mechanism in PoS-BFL ensure the stakes of legitimate nodes, and effectively reduce the impact of malicious nodes on the accuracy of the system model. And the experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PoS-BFL can achieve 86% accuracy, which is much higher than vanilla FL and pFedMe, and PoS-BFL is robust to some extent by adjusting the ratio of workers, validators and miners.",

  "abstract": "The increased density of the urban population and frequent transportation movement has lead to parking issues in these areas. Many efforts have been made to efficiently utilize the existing parking facilities. Most of these solutions target the large-scale private and public parking facilities; however, the individual parking facilities are not much explored and exploited for reducing the parking issues. In the last few years, the Online-to-Offline (O2O) model has witnessed huge attention from the research community due to its versatile applications in many domains. The main objective of the O2O model is to create service awareness online, allowing potential users to review different offers and then visit local physical places for purchasing. The security of the users’ data has always been considered a crucial factor in any public sharing platform. The blockchain model has been regarded as a solid security platform for many public sharing platforms. This work designed a blockchain framework with a novel data verification and role-based Access control method for securing the parking service data. Several experiments are performed using the sawtooth blockchain tool to investigate the performance of the proposed blockchain framework against the baseline approach concerning latency, meantime testing (MTT), throughput, transaction sending rate (TPS), and average response time (ART). The obtained results confirm that the proposed approach is scalable and feasible for smart parking and other IoT-based applications.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain as the trust‐enabling technology has supported and transformed cyber-physical systems in recent years. Therefore, many organizations have adopted blockchain-based technology to develop industrial software-product-service systems. However, the implementation of blockchain at the organizational levels can be related with several technical, organizational, legal, financial, and environmental challenges (intra-organizational and inter-organizational). Analysis of these challenges will play a significant role in organizational performance. This study has investigated an extensive list of challenges of software blockchain-based implementation in cyber-physical systems. The proposed comprehensive model is applied to the software development industry in Iran as a case study. Based on the experts’ opinions, challenge identification was conducted via the two-phase fuzzy Delphi method for medium and large organizations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance. It is mentionable that most technical challenges have higher priority than other considered challenges.",

  "title": "Throughput-oriented associated transaction assignment in sharding blockchains for IoT social data storage",
  "abstract": "Blockchain is a viable solution to provide data integrity for the enormous volume of 5G IoT social data, while we need to break through the throughput bottleneck of blockchain. Sharding is a promising technology to solve the problem of low throughput in blockchains. However, cross-shard communication hinders the effective improvement of blockchain throughput. Therefore, it is critical to reasonably allocate transactions to different shards to improve blockchain throughput. Existing research on blockchain sharding mainly focuses on shards formation, configuration, and consensus, while ignoring the negative impact of cross-shard communication on blockchain throughput. Aiming to maximize the throughput of transaction processing, we study how to allocate blockchain transactions to shards in this paper. We propose an Associated Transaction assignment algorithm based on Closest Fit (ATCF). ATCF classifies associated transactions into transaction groups which are then assigned to different shards in the non-ascending order of transaction group sizes periodically. Within each epoch, ATCF tries to select a shard that can handle all the transactions for each transaction group. If there are multiple such shards, ATCF selects the shard with the remaining processing capacity closest to the number of transactions in the transaction group. When no such shard exists, ATCF chooses the shard with the largest remaining processing capacity for the transaction group. The transaction groups that cannot be completely processed within the current epoch will be allocated in the subsequent epochs. We prove that ATCF is a 2-approximation algorithm for the associated transaction assignment problem. Simulation results show that ATCF can effectively improve the blockchain throughput and reduce the number of cross-shard transactions.",

  "abstract": "The current price guided demand response mechanism is difficult to accurately achieve the expected load reduction goal for the grid company, while the direct control demand response mechanism cannot meet the requirements of users for autonomous power consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate an incentive compatible demand response mechanism to take the needs of demand-side users and the grid company into account. Based on the current bidding demand response program, a two-stage transaction mechanism of demand response quota based on blockchain is proposed in this work. Firstly, a two-stage transaction mechanism for demand response quota considering day-ahead bidding transaction and intra-day double auction transaction is designed. Then, the smart contract is introduced to realize the proposed blockchain-based two-stage transaction mechanism of demand response quota, and all the smart contract functions involved in each business link are customized. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed transaction mechanism of demand response quota is illustrated by the simulation results on the platform of Remix IDE.",

  "title": "TABS: Transforming automatically BPMN models into blockchain smart contracts",
  "abstract": "Research on blockchains addresses multiple issues, with one being automated creation of smart contracts. Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to develop smart contracts with the objective to automate the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce risks of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

  "title": "Blockchain and homomorphic encryption based privacy-preserving model aggregation for medical images",
  "abstract": "Medical healthcare centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data for COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and training models within a single organization. This practice can be considered a weakness as it leads to several privacy and security concerns related to raw data communication. To overcome this weakness and secure raw data communication, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides a solution for collaborative data training. The proposed framework enables the coordination of multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models while preserving data privacy. Blockchain ledger technology provides decentralization of federated learning models without relying on a central server. Moreover, the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of the model to preserve privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: (i) train the local model by a novel capsule network for segmentation and classification of COVID-19 images, (ii) furthermore, we use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, (iii) finally, the model is shared over a decentralized platform through the proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing over the decentralized network. To validate our proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.",

  "title": "A Blockchain and modified Best-worst algorithm enhanced Blackboard model for stranger collaboration based social product design",
  "abstract": "Social product design (SPD) is a new kind of product design pattern emerged under the background of sharing economic trends and fast developing online communication technologies. Due to the participation of large numbers of socialized designers (SDs), SPD pattern has the capability of utilizing socialized design resources to increase the design power of design companies with relatively lower costs. However, the SDs have the characteristics of self-driven, self-organized, unaffiliated, distributed and discontinuous participation, and stranger collaboration. These characteristics lead to the problems of low collaboration efficiency, low controllability, and low mutual trust during SPD process. Consequently these problems could limit the industrial application of SPD in relatively complicated and intellectual property issues involved design projects. Addressing these problems, a Blockchain and modified Best-worst algorithm enhanced Blackboard model is established. The Blackboard model with customized components can improve the collaboration efficiency and orderliness among SDs. The Blockchain can realize reliable recording of the discontinuous participation of SDs in SPD process. On this basis, a modified Best-Worst algorithm is established to support the estimation of the contribution degrees of SDs during SPD process. Combined together, the model can improve the operability of SPD application. A 3D printer concept design project was used as case study, and the result shows that the model can improve the operability of SPD pattern in relatively complicated and intellectual property issues involved design projects compared with ordinary crowdsourcing or opensourcing design models, but its higher operating cost may limit its application only for high valued design projects.",

  "title": "Improving blockchain performance in clinical trials using intelligent optimal transaction traffic control mechanism in smart healthcare applications",
  "abstract": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized the ways of processing and storing data in terms of reliability and security. Blockchain plays a pivotal role in transferring the processing hurdle from the client–server to a decentralized and secured platform. Blockchain is deemed to be an efficient technology in a forthcoming era that would beneficiate multifarious industries. An issue that becomes a bottleneck for blockchain-based applications is their restricted ability to process in comparison to distributed database systems. In this paper, we present intelligent traffic control using a hybrid model based on the PSO-based optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic in order to improve blockchain performance. The real-time network feedback model is designed and used as an input to control the transaction traffic across the entire network in a robust way without human intervention. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed model, a clinical trial service framework as a test network is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric. The case study is further compared with baseline network, network with fuzzy approach, and network with optimized parameter. The experiments show that the proposed model not only enhanced the network by maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the network latency. A smart contract is implemented to automate the transaction flow as per real-time data of network conditions. An open-source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is harnessed for implementation of the experiment environment in order to signify the potential of the proposed model. The outcome of this study indicated a remarkable increase in transaction throughput (i.e., 38.5%) and a decrease in transaction latency of 40.5%. Moreover, the proposed model can easily be integrated with other existing blockchain-based performance-enhancing tools.",

  "title": "Joint time scheduling and transaction fee selection in blockchain-based RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio network",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-and backscatter-aided Internet of Things (IoT) system. In the framework, IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a secondary gateway by using an RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the framework enables an IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under dynamics of the primary channel, uncertainty of the IoT devices, and unpredictability of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i) time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and (iii) a transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then propose to employ, evaluate, and assess a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the gateway. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based AMI framework for data security and privacy protection",
  "abstract": "As a key component of smart grid (SG), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) realizes two-way communication between users and power companies. Considering that AMI involves a large number of important data, which are related to the measurement of users’ electricity bills and the decision-making of power suppliers. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of AMI data security and privacy to avoid economic losses caused by data leakage and tampering. Aiming at the problems of trust and single point of failure in the existing protection schemes, this paper proposes an AMI security framework based on blockchain. By combining the characteristics of blockchain such as decentration, tamper proof, traceability, the architecture of AMI data management system is reshaped. The technologies of peer-to-peer (P2P) transmission, asymmetric encryption, consensus algorithm and smart contract of blockchain are used to solve the problems of secure storage, transmission and application of AMI data. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the feasibility of introducing blockchain technology into AMI is verified. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and reliable, which provides a strong guarantee for AMI data security and privacy protection.",

  "abstract": "This paper presents a continuous delivery/continuous verifiability (CD/CV) method for IoT dataflows in edge–fog–cloud. A CD model based on extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) mechanism as well as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction, enable end-users to create efficient schemes for the continuous verification and validation of the execution of applications in edge–fog–cloud infrastructures. This scheme also verifies and validates established execution sequences and the integrity of digital assets. CV model converts ETL and DAG into business model, smart contracts in a private blockchain for the automatic and transparent registration of transactions performed by each application in workflows/pipelines created by CD model without altering applications nor edge–fog–cloud workflows. This model ensures that IoT dataflows delivers verifiable information for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes with certainty. A containerized parallelism model solves portability issues and reduces/compensates the overhead produced by CD/CV operations. We developed and implemented a prototype to create CD/CV schemes, which were evaluated in a case study where user mobility information is used to identify interest points, patterns, and maps. The experimental evaluation revealed the efficiency of CD/CV to register the transactions performed in IoT dataflows through edge–fog–cloud in a private blockchain network in comparison with state-of-art solutions.",

  "title": "A survey on blockchain, SDN and NFV for the smart-home security",
  "abstract": "Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users’ daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.",

  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a high-performance, scalable Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol TSBFT for the consortium blockchains that does not rely on expensive leader-driven communication. It overcomes the challenges faced by the existing BFT protocol in three aspects: single-point failure, huge total message sizes, and limited by the slowest nodes. The proposed protocol secretly selects block proposers and uses threshold signature as a multi-round voting mechanism to confirm the validity of the proposed block. We adopt transmission pipelining to improve the network utilization while optimizing the gossip communication scheme to reduce the total message sizes. Finally, our protocol guarantees the security and liveness of the system. Experimental results show that, compared with other related BFT protocols (e.g., PBFT), TSBFT can effectively solve these three challenges. In addition, our experiments also show how the different optimization ingredients of TSBFT contribute to its performance and scalability. The results show that compared with the traditional BFT protocol, it can scale from dozens of nodes to hundreds of nodes.",

  "title": "Proposing a new LSGDM framework based on BWM with hesitant fuzzy information for prioritizing blockchain adoption barriers in supply chain",
  "abstract": "Due to the vast advantages of Blockchain technology, especially transparency of information and the ability to track transactions, this technology has been considered in several areas, including supply chain management (SCM). However, due to the emergence of this technology, numerous barriers and limitations have hindered its use. Due to the special conditions of developing countries (such as Iran), there is still a need for independent research to localize these barriers in these countries. On the other hand, most of the research has focused more on identifying barriers and less on prioritizing them. Examining the specific features of the Blockchain technology field shows that there is a need to provide a decision-making framework based on large-scale group decision-making methods (LSGDM), which, in addition to simultaneously paying attention to the advantages of previous approaches (including the participation of different groups of stakeholders; the consensus reaching process (CRP) as well as the uncertainty and doubt of the stakeholders in the evaluations), can increase the applicability of the method by reducing the number of pairwise comparisons. Therefore, while identifying and localizing the list of barriers in Iran, the LSGDM method along with the proposed consensus framework can be used to aggregate the opinions between the experts in a network and create a relative consensus between them. The use of hesitant fuzzy (HF) sets has made it possible to model the uncertainty and hesitancy in the opinions of experts. Also, using the Best-Worst method (BWM) instead of the pairwise comparison approach between all criteria, has reduced the number of pairwise comparisons and provided other advantages such as reduced inconsistency and higher reliability. The results of applying this framework in Iran showed that lack of awareness and customer orientation, scalability and lack of management participation and support are the main barriers to the implementation of the blockchain for SCM in this developing country. The results can help decision makers and policy makers in this area to plan more accurately.",

  "title": "A survey on blockchain-enabled federated learning and its prospects with digital twin",
  "abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) supports real time analysis and provides a reliable simulation platform in the Internet of Things (IoT). The creation and application of DT hinges on amounts of data, which poses pressure on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for DT descriptions and intelligent decision-making. Federated Learning (FL) is a cutting-edge technology that enables geographically dispersed devices to collaboratively train a shared global model locally rather than relying on a data center to perform model training. Therefore, DT can benefit by combining with FL, successfully solving the ”data island” problem in traditional AI. However, FL still faces serious challenges, such as enduring single-point failures, suffering from poison attacks, lacking effective incentive mechanisms. Before the successful deployment of DT, we should tackle the issues caused by FL. Researchers from industry and academia have recognized the potential of introducing Blockchain Technology (BT) into FL to overcome the challenges faced by FL, where BT acting as a distributed and immutable ledger, can store data in a secure, traceable, and trusted manner. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive literature review on this topic is still missing. In this paper, we review existing works about blockchain-enabled FL and visualize their prospects with DT. To this end, we first propose evaluation requirements with respect to security, fault-tolerance, fairness, efficiency, cost-saving, profitability, and support for heterogeneity. Then, we classify existing literature according to the functionalities of BT in FL and analyze their advantages and disadvantages based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Finally, we discuss open problems in the existing literature and the future of DT supported by blockchain-enabled FL, based on which we further propose some directions for future research.",

  "abstract": "IoMT technology has many advantages in healthcare system, such as optimizing the medical service model, improving the efficiency of hospital operation and management, and improving the overall service level of the hospital. IoMT devices do not have a security authentication mechanism, and the trust between devices relies heavily on centralized third-party services. Blockchain can provide a secure interactive environment for the medical Internet of Things. However, security issues in the IoMT-Blockchain environment are also becoming increasingly prominent. Cyber-attacks targeting IoMT-Blockchain will not only compromise the security of IoT devices, but also seriously affect the security of the Internet. Therefore, how to detect abnormal traffic in the IoMT-Blockchain environment becomes particularly important. In this work, an abnormal traffic detection with deep neural network is designed for abnormal traffic detection in IoMT-Blockchain environment. First, this work proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on multi-model autoencoders. The algorithm processes the feature information in groups to reduce the complexity between traffic feature information. It builds a multi-model autoencoder to further extract fusion features between multi-model features. Second, to maximize use of traffic data information in detection network, this work proposes a multi-feature sequence anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm extracts low-level fusion features and high-level temporal features in network traffic respectively, and applies the features to anomaly detection and classification tasks by means of residual learning.",

  "abstract": "Network marketing is a trading technique that provides companies with the opportunity to increase sales. With the increasing number of Internet-based purchases, several threats are increasingly observed in this field, such as use privacy violations, company owner (CO) fraud, the changing of sold products' information, and the scalability of selling networks. This study presents the concept of a blockchain-based market called ACR-MLM that functions based on the multi-level marketing (MLM) model, through which registered users receive anonymous and confidential rewards for their own and their subgroups' sales. Applying a public blockchain as the ACR-MLM framework's infrastructure solves existing problems in MLM-based markets, such as CO fraud (against the government or its users), user privacy violations (obtaining their real names or subgroup users), and scalability (when vast numbers of users have been registered). To provide confidentiality and scalability to the ACR-MLM framework, hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) was applied with a functional encryption (FE) scheme. Finally, the security of ACR-MLM is analyzed using the random oracle (RO) model and then evaluated.",

  "abstract": "The global trend of credentialism as well as increased mobility in studies and work bring new requirements regarding the verification of academic qualifications. So far, traditional nostrification processes face challenges related to high process cycle times, elevated fees, and fraud incidents. In the higher education domain, blockchain-based approaches have emerged to revitalize the verification of academic qualifications, but they mostly rely on closed concepts offering their facility to a limited circle of entities. As a result, the verification of degrees is not publicly available to any third party. Moreover, in most cases, a concise process-aware approach describing the intended functionality with appropriate models is missing; this absence raises ambiguity and trust issues in the implemented application. This paper presents the design and early implementation of the VerDe (Verified Degrees) platform; a proposed blockchain-based application for registration and verification of academic qualifications. The novelty of the approach presented in this paper is the implementation of VerDe as a decentralized application utilizing Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN). This work demonstrates that usage of BPMN constructs provides an efficient method in addressing blockchain usability and complexity issues and facilitates the design and implementation of blockchain-based applications. The benefits of deploying VerDe in conjunction with BPMN are an efficient and transparent facility able to handle mobility consequences, detect fraud, and overcome administrative barriers by offering the verification capability to any third-party, and employing a custom-made token that emulates the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).",

  "abstract": "Data sharing services based on massive IoT data have been widely used in various fields such as health monitoring and image recognition, providing users with more reliable, efficient, and flexible data services and significantly improving the user service quality. With the popularization of IoT applications, the usage rate of IoT data is getting higher and higher. Due to the dangerous network environment, the security of IoT data faces challenges. On the one hand, attacks such as data tampering can lead to the failure of IoT tasks, and on the other hand, the intrusion of malicious users can lead to the collapse of the entire IoT network. In recent years, many protection schemes used for IoT data security have been proposed. However, security flaws still exist in these schemes. Therefore, to solve the data security and identity security issues in the IoT data sharing process, in this paper, we propose a TEE-and-Blockchain-supported IoT data sharing architecture(TEBDS), which combines on-chain and off-chain methods to meet the security requirements of the IoT data sharing framework. Therein, the consortium blockchain realizes the protection of on-chain IoT data and the access control of IoT users. An Intel SGX-based Distributed Storage System (SDSS) is proposed to secure off-chain data. Besides, an incentive mechanism is developed to facilitate the whole system. Security analysis shows that TEBDS meets the requirements of data security and identity security. Experimental results show that TEBDS has better performance than the centralized method SPDS.",

  "abstract": "Modern healthcare systems are complex and regularly share sensitive data among multiple stakeholders, such as doctors, patients, and pharmacists. Patients’ data has increased and requires safe methods for its management. Research works related to blockchain, such as MIT MedRec, have strived to draft trustworthy and immutable systems to share data. However, blockchain may be challenging in healthcare scenarios due to issues about privacy and control of data sharing destinations. This paper presents a protocol for tracking shared medical data, which includes images, and controlling the medical data access by multiple conflicting stakeholders. Several efforts rely on blockchain for healthcare, but just a few are concerned about malicious data leakage in blockchain-based healthcare systems. We implement a token mechanism stored in DICOM files and managed by Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain. Our findings and evaluations revealed low chances of a hash collision, such as employing a fitting-resistance birthday attack. Although our solution was devised for healthcare, it can inspire and be easily ported to other blockchain-based application scenarios, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Besu for business networks.",

  "title": "Blockchain in healthcare and IoT: A systematic literature review",
  "abstract": "Blockchain technology is a highly regarded technology that possesses a plethora of exciting features. This paper analyzes trends and highlights the potential benefits of blockchain deployment in IoT and healthcare. According to the literature, blockchain technology is mostly utilized for data management operations in healthcare and IoT, specifically to improve data security, which includes data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. In both areas, six distinct types of data security preservation strategies are applied. Additionally, publications highlight how blockchain and IoT, including health IoT, can be used in an integrative way. Three integration mechanisms were seen to accomplish this goal. These solutions range from fully integrating blockchain into data exchanges between IoT devices to using it solely for metadata storage. The most frequently covered area of IoT is a smart city, where blockchain is utilized to improve real-time data sharing, and electricity trading, and so on. Additionally, it is learned that, despite the numerous benefits of blockchain in healthcare, authors typically use it for drug supply chain management and data management purposes in order to avoid counterfeiting and empower patients with regard to their data, respectively.",

  "title": "Synchronizing DDoS defense at network edge with P4, SDN, and Blockchain",
  "abstract": "Botnet-originated DDoS attacks continue to plague the internet and disrupt services for legitimate users. While various proposals have been presented in the last two decades, the botnet still has advantages over the defenders, because botnets have orchestrated processes to launch disruptive attacks. On the other hand, the defenders use manual methods, siloed tools, and lack orchestration among different organizations. These unorchestrated efforts slow down the attack response and extend the lifespan of botnet attacks. This article presents shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN, an inter-organization collaborative defense framework using P4, SDN, and Blockchain, which extends our earlier research on microVNF, a solution of Edge security for SIP-enabled IoT devices with P4. Besides mitigating DDoS attacks, microVNF also produces attack fingerprints called Indicator of Compromise (IOC) records. ShieldSDN and shieldCHAIN distribute these IOCs to other organizations so that they can create their own packet filters. Effectively, shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN synchronize packet filters for different organizations to mitigate against the same botnet strain. Four experiments were performed successfully to validate the functionalities of shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN. The scope for the first experiment was intra-company, while the second, third, and fourth experiments were inter-company. In the first experiment, shieldSDN extracted IOCs from the source switch and installed these as packet filters on other switches within the same organization (in the U.S.). In the second experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the publishing organization (in the U.S.) shared IOCs by posting them to the Blockchain. In the third experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations (in Singapore & the U.K.) retrieved these IOCs from Blockchain. Finally, in the last experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations installed the retrieved IOCs as packet filters; that are identical to those in the originating organization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that uses the P4 switch, SDN controller, and Blockchain together for this use case. As SDN and Blockchain gain acceptance, this framework empowers community members to collaborate and defend against botnet DDoS attacks.",

  "title": "Efficient sharing of privacy-preserving sensing data on consortium blockchain via group key agreement",
  "abstract": "Due to the self-organizing and distributed nature of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), valuable data in sensor networks faces security and privacy risks. A blockchain-based approach enables secure and convenient sharing of sensor information among different users. Compared to public and private blockchains, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases in WSN due to its auditability and high transaction rate. However, sensing data sharing via consortium blockchain raises the privacy issue. Therefore, the data from the sensor node is encrypted by the key (named\n) shared by the sensor node and the sink node and then sent to the blockchain network to not reveal the privacy of the sensing data. Since the infrastructure in large-scale WSN is usually owned and managed by multiple organizations, encrypted sensing data needs to be authorized by these multiple organizations for computation. Organizations requesting privacy-preserving data are referred to as data sharers. Distributing the\nto each data sharer requires separate encryption of the key using the data sharer’s public key. The sink node needs to be online when each data sharer asks for the\n, and one encryption of the\nfor each data sharer consumes precious resources. This work proposes GSChain for efficient privacy-preserving sensing data sharing on consortium blockchain. Multiple data sharers resort to asymmetric group key agreement protocol to maintain a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys, enabling efficient\nretrieval from the consortium blockchain. The\nis encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain along with the privacy-preserving sensing data. Our scheme improves the efficiency of privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple data sharers while reducing the online demand for sink nodes. Although the data-sharing group should remain stable for a long time, we design the group key update scheme. We also discuss how old and new data sharers access different ranges of privacy-preserving sensing data as the data-sharing group changes. We build a complete implementation of GSChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and conduct a comprehensive set of experimental studies. Our experimental results demonstrate that GSChain improves the privacy-preserving sensing data sharing efficiency with tolerable time and storage overhead. In addition, the time overhead caused by the recovery of the GSChain system is tolerable when the membership of the data-sharing group changes.",

  "abstract": "Smart contracts allow application developers to automate business processes through a decentralized computation architecture. Contemporary blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric offer support for smart contracts through consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or other types of transaction validation and ordering services. This article exploits smart contracts in the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain platforms. In particular, we explore Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu, BFT blockchain platforms, and apply them to a decentralized e-prescription case study to evaluate their effectiveness. We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet. Our article empirically evaluates the performance of smart contracts in Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu using a decentralized medical prescription case study and compares their results with Ethereum, a PoW blockchain. Our results demonstrate that BFT blockchain platforms are efficient for multi-stakeholder applications such as e-prescription and supply chains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms, such as Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu.",

  "title": "On-chain behavior prediction Machine Learning model for blockchain-based crowdsourcing",
  "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of behavior prediction for task allocation in blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers’ reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task’s context on the worker’s behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker’s unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers’ predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers’ reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers’ QoI, and reputation change.",

  "title": "Privacy-preserving Blockchain-assisted private-parking scheme with efficient matching",
  "abstract": "Due to the drastic increase in the number of vehicles, searching for available parking spots has become a major problem for drivers, especially in crowded and big cities. Thus, a smart parking system is crucial not only to facilitate drivers’ ability to find parking spaces, but also to reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and vehicles’ gas consumption. A growing number of public parking lots have been constructed to provide parking spots for drivers. Meanwhile, homeowners and landowners leave their private spaces that can be utilized and rented for other drivers seeking parking spaces. This paper proposes a decentralized smart private-parking scheme built on top of Blockchain. Blockchain is used to run and organize the developed parking scheme to help drivers find nearby parking spots owned by private homeowners and landowners. However, parking owners and drivers should send requests/offers that include the location/time information of spots and/or desired locations to park at. This information can be used to track daily live activities for both drivers and parking owners such as whether a parking owner is at home or not, drivers’ destinations, etc. To preserve privacy, in the proposed scheme, drivers/parking owners submit their requests/offers in an encrypted format, and the Blockchain can find feasible matches among the encrypted requests and offers without the need to get access to original sensitive information. In addition, an overlapping and partitioning technique is used to generate the requests/offers to increase matching results by finding more nearby drivers to park and thus maximizing parking owners’ profits. Finally, the proposed scheme has been implemented on Hyperledger Blockchain and extensive evaluations have been conducted using different simulation scenarios. The results indicate that the scheme is efficient in terms of scalability and throughput under different case scenarios. Also, security and privacy analysis are conducted to demonstrate that the scheme can run the services securely while ensuring drivers/parking owners’ privacy.",

  "title": "Modeling and analysis of port supply chain system based on Fabric blockchain",
  "abstract": "With the development of international trade, the core position of port transportation progressively emerges. However, most current port supply chain systems adopt a centralized data management mode. Each operator in the supply chain has its platform and data set, which is prone to form information islands and can create trust issues, resulting in the inefficient overall operation of the supply chain. To improve the efficiency of the supply chain, a port supply chain system based on Fabric blockchain (Fabric-PSChain) is designed and implemented. In the proposed system, four smart contracts are developed by taking advantage of the blockchain’s decentralized, tamper-free, distributed consensus, combined with the Role-Based Access Control Policy (RBACP), realizing the functions of access control policy formulation, enterprise list query, cargo order uploading, and order query. At the same time, the regulator node is added to the Fabric-PSchain system to enhance the credibility and security of data and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Experimental results show that the Fabric-PSChain system has vital confidentiality and data sharing that can speed up the operation of the port supply chain business and has significant application value for the shipping logistics industry.",

  "title": "BPPIR: Blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving similarity image retrieval over multiple clouds",
  "abstract": "With the progress of the times and the development of electronic products, more and more images are captured and stored on multiple cloud servers, which are more likely to exhibit dishonesty because of interdependence rather than semi-honesty and thus how to achieve search over multiple clouds becomes intractable. Moreover, most of the existing research works on content-based image retrieval so far do not consider dishonest clouds and thereby do not support multi-cloud retrieval. On the one hand, a central search server is generally introduced for the convenience of retrieval in the system with multiple cloud servers. However, the central search server may return false or incomplete search results for possible commercial profit, which reduces the retrieval accuracy. On the other hand, cloud servers may destroy the image integrity by deleting or tampering images to save computing and bandwidth resources, resulting in the loss of important information for the image owner and incorrect decryption of the image for the user. In order to address these two problems, we propose a blockchain-assisted privacy-protected similarity image retrieval in the multiple cloud environment, which can not only ensure the accuracy of the retrieval results, but also can verify the integrity of images. The performance of this scheme is evaluated on a real-world dataset, and the results show the high retrieval precision and efficiency of this scheme.",

  "title": "Analysis of Blockchain's enablers for improving sustainable supply chain transparency in Africa cocoa industry",
  "abstract": "Blockchain technology can improve supply chain transparency to solve many problems in agricultural supply chains, such as lack of social responsibility and poor environmental performance. However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is “Technical Characteristics”, and the top three sub-enablers are: “blockchain smart contract”, “blockchain security,” and “tracking product components”, respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT. As far as we know, this paper is one of the first studies to evaluate blockchain's enablers for SSCT, especially in the context of African emerging economies.",

  "abstract": "Blockchain and the programs running on it, called smart contracts, are increasingly applied in all fields where trust and strong certifications are required. Our work focuses on industrial applications of blockchains and not on cryptocurrencies or tokens. We use frameworks to compare public and permissioned blockchains specifically suited for industrial applications. We also propose a complete solution based on Ethereum to implement a decentralized application, putting together in an original way, components and patterns already used and proven. This solution is characterized by a set of validator nodes running the blockchain using Proof-of-Authority or similar efficient consensus algorithms, by the use of an explorer enabling users to check the blockchain state, and the source code of the smart contracts running on it. From time to time, the hash digest of the last mined block is written into a public blockchain to guarantee immutability. The right to send transactions is granted by validator nodes to users by endowing them with the Ethers mined locally. Overall, the proposed approach has the same transparency and immutability as a public blockchain, largely reducing its drawbacks.",

  "title": "A novel blockchain-enabled heart disease prediction mechanism using machine learning",
  "abstract": "Heart disease is one of the leading causes for death in men and women across the globe. Several characteristics that can be monitored to predict the heart disease in the earlier stage are blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar level and body weight. The technology is revolutionizing the existing healthcare infrastructure. With the inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT), now we can monitor patients remotely, store their data, and process it for further analysis. However, the need is to propose new and advanced secured algorithms for fast processing and efficient detection of events. In this article, a machine learning based Sine Cosine Weighted K-Nearest Neighbour (SCA_WKNN) algorithm is proposed for the heart disease prediction that learns from the data being stored in blockchain. Since the data stored in the blockchain are tamper resistant, it acts as an authentic source for learning data and also as a secure storage environment for patient information. The performance of proposed SCA_WKNN is assessed in comparison with other algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and root mean square error. Our analysis indicates that SCA_WKNN achieves 4.59% and 15.61% maximum accuracy than W K-NN and K-NN, respectively. Also, blockchain-based storage is compared with peer-to-peer storage in terms of latency and throughput. The blockchain-based decentralized storage achieves 25.03% maximum throughput than peer-to-peer storage.",

  "title": "A blockchain-based model with an incentive mechanism for cross-border logistics supervision and data sharing in modular construction",
  "abstract": "Sustainability in cross-border logistics requires issues such as fragmented management to be addressed. Particular challenges arise in cross-border logistics in modular construction (CLMC) because supervision is inefficient, primarily due to continued use of paper-based documentation. Researchers have developed digital platforms that integrate accurate prefabricated module location information but their centralized operation creates information security issues such as tampering. Blockchain technology can overcome this limitation but relies on user participation. This study, therefore, develops a blockchain-based supervision (BBS) model with incentives for application in CLMC. The BBS model is developed using a design science research approach to enhance supervision of CLMC and motivate users to share data promptly, and then a prototype system is developed and evaluated in a CLMC case. The results show that the system brings a positive change in product accountability (df = 8, t = 0.6601, p = 0.528) compared with current paper-based recording process (df = 8, t = 0.0035, p = 0.997), and a positive change in data traceability (df = 8, t = 1.468, p = 0.180) compared with existing process (df = 8, t = 0.042, p = 0.967). In addition, this study obtains higher scores (552) than others in evaluating the incentive mechanisms. The security analysis is also discussed through data immutability, non-repudiation, authentication, and authorization. The ﬁndings of this study pave the way for a tamper-proof, incentive-enabled supervision mechanism in modular construction.",

  "title": "Enhancing blockchain-based filtration mechanism via IPFS for collaborative intrusion detection in IoT networks",
  "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) has become more important for setting up a smart environment, e.g., smart home. It is a network of connected devices, which can provide many benefits such as automating and controlling the tasks on a daily basis without human intervention. While due to the dispersed structure, IoT networks are vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). To protect such environment, building a suitable collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) is essential by enabling the exchange of required data among nodes. In addition, deploying a packet filtration mechanism with CIDN is necessary to reduce unwanted events and traffic. However, how to safeguard the integrity of exchanged information is a challenge, because a malicious internal node can manipulate and deliver untruthful data. Motivated by the blockchain technology, in this work, we develop a blockchain-based filtration mechanism with CIDN to help protect the security of IoT networks by refining unexpected events. In addition, we leverage IPFS technology to host and share information like blacklist. In the evaluation, we examine the filter performance with three real datasets, a simulated environment and a practical environment, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our filter compared with similar studies.",

  "abstract": "The 5G communication technology and edge computing jointly form 5G Edge and eliminate the constraints of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) devices to facilitate several real-time healthcare services, including patient monitoring and diagnoses from anywhere. Nevertheless, the 5G Edge platform introduces risks of internal attacks to the data integrity and privacy of IoMT data. Hence, end users cannot trust data retrieved from the 5G Edge. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving search result certification framework for IoMT data on 5G and edge computing-assisted blockchain networks. The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, the proposed framework introduces a blockchain platform involving 5G Edge servers to ensure tamperproof data storage. In addition, an encrypted data storage model and a symmetric-key cryptography-based privacy-preserving search mechanism are developed for the 5G Edge blockchain. Second, the framework leverages an efficient multi-signature scheme to design a tamperproof search result certification mechanism for IoMT data on the blockchain of 5G Edge. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.",

  "abstract": "Critical effects of global climate change urgently call for socio-technical transitions towards more efficient, flexible and cleaner energy systems. However, adequate regulatory frameworks and policy incentives are lagging behind. This paper focuses on the governance dynamics shaping technology-enabled transitions towards distributed energy systems. The purpose of this review is to assess the potential role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions. The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced coordination for community-based energy transitions.",

  "abstract": "As more and more mobile devices and IoT terminals are connected to the Internet, a huge amount of spatio-temporal data is generated. In order to cope with the pressure of storing and computing massive amounts of data locally and to share data to fully utilize its value, data owners usually store data in cloud servers. However, the data owner will lose physical control of big spatio-temporal data while the big spatio-temporal data is stored on the cloud, and it will be at the risk of being tampered with and deleted. Therefore, this paper designs a blockchain-based secure storage mechanism, BSMD, which adopts an on-chain and off-chain cooperative storage model to alleviate the shortage of blockchain storage capacity. The updatable subvector commitment designed in this paper is used to construct the on-chain and off-chain secure authentication protocol which ensures the consistency of on-chain and off-chain data and makes the protocol have the capability of batch processing. Finally, the correctness and security of the proposed protocol are proved, and the performance of the protocol is analyzed.",

  "abstract": "The transparent and immutable nature of blockchain provides incentives for organizations wishing to create and implement an open, decentralized governance structure. As members exercise their voting rights, a fault-tolerant record accumulates on the blockchain that can be analyzed to diagnose and intercept potential threats to the governing body. To date, there has not been a systematic study of on-chain governance with respect to voting. In this paper, we provide an analysis of blockchain governance through a case study of the first cryptocurrency to adopt on-chain voting, Dash. Our analysis introduces the key characteristics of blockchain governance, steps through a data-driven exploration of Dash's on-chain voting system, and highlights exploitable attack vectors and vulnerabilities for the subversion of Dash's on-chain voting system via a novel network analysis methodology. We then conclude with guidelines for other organizations looking to implement similar blockchain governance solutions while maintaining integrity in their operations.",

  "title": "T2L: A traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics",
  "abstract": "Traceability and trustiness are two critical issues in the logistics sector. Blockchain provides a potential way for logistics tracking systems due to its traits of tamper resistance. However, it is non-trivial to apply blockchain on logistics because of firstly, the binding relationship between virtue data and physical location cannot be guaranteed so that frauds may exist. Secondly, it is neither practical to upload complete data on the blockchain due to the limited storage resources nor convincing to trust the digest of the data. This paper proposes a traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics T2L to provide an efficient solution to the mentioned problems. Specifically, the authenticated geocoding data from telecom operators’ base stations are adopted to ensure the location credibility of the data before being uploaded to the blockchain for the purpose of reliable traceability of the logistics. Moreover, we propose a scheme based on Zero Knowledge Proof of Retrievability (ZK BLS-PoR) to ensure the trustiness of the data digest and the proofs to the blockchain. Any user in the system can check the data completeness by verifying the proofs instead of downloading and examining the whole data based on the proposed ZK BLS- PoR scheme, which can provide solid theoretical verification. In all, the proposed T2L framework is a traceable and trustable logistics system with a high level of security.",

  "title": "Theoretical and practical applications of blockchain in healthcare information management",
  "abstract": "A primary objective of blockchain technology is to address information security and efficiency issues related to existing information sharing systems. For the sharing of health records, little is known about the application of blockchain in management information systems. There are strict regulations for sharing health information due to insecure systems and privacy concerns. To significantly and effectively improve medical diagnosis, it is beneficial to have efficient, reliable, and accurate accessibility to a patient's full medical history. Due to concerns with the security of health systems and privacy concerns, medical histories are not always accessible to healthcare providers. To help increase accessibility options, this research proposes a blockchain-based model that facilitates sharing medical records in a manner that is beneficial to both healthcare providers and patients. Social exchange theory provides the theoretical support for the conceptual model presented. Experimental findings based on 151 participants revealed that the blockchain technology can provide a secure information system and increase patient motivation to share medical records. To show the applicability of the proposed use of blockchain from a practical managerial perspective, we show feasibility by developing an Android software application.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based verifiable and dynamic multi-keyword ranked searchable encryption scheme in cloud computing",
  "abstract": "Rational miners in the blockchain may admit the validity of search results directly to conserve calculation overhead without executing the validation. Such phenomenon is known as the Verifier's Dilemma that the search results of the blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme would be claimed to have been verified but devoid of valid verification. Besides, the top-k query technique utilized by most existing searchable encryption schemes fails to filter the search results from the user demands during retrieval, which results in massive ineffective access lists with high complexity. Aiming at the two problems, we present a blockchain-based multi-keyword ranked searchable encryption scheme and design a fair payment protocol for multi-user scenarios. Our scheme may achieve public verifiability and user fairness by leveraging the TrueBit network, while the data owner (DO) can withdraw search privileges from the authorized data user (DU). Also, we extend the searchable encryption scheme based on inverted index to multi-DO/multi-DU scenarios, and the HashMap index is used to diminish the response time and space complexity. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports the update of index keywords and files dynamically. To enhance retrieval accuracy, we modify the information divergence algorithm in machine learning and utilize the monotonically weighted aggregation function, which improves retrieval accuracy to around 97%. Finally, Security analysis illustrates correctness and resilience against typical attacks to verify the robustness and utility of the proposed scheme.",

  "title": "Vericom: A Verification and Communication architecture for IoT-based blockchain",
  "abstract": "Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a secure, distributed, and anonymous framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). As a distributed system, blockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the technology’s adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions and blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits scalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing solutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization, limiting the technology’s original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a distributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for blockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high scalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains from broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains where all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of IoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks which in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers: (i) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced along with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks, from the source to the destination, and (ii) verification layer where a set of randomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The performance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing overhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet overhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the processing overhead remains scale-independent.",

  "title": "Blockchain-based secure and trusted data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicle underlying 5G",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes a blockchain-based secure and reliable data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It aims to secure data sharing among AVs. We integrate the fifth-generation (5G) communication network with the proposed blockchain-based scheme to enable ultra-low latency, high reliability, and availability. We have incorporated the edge intelligence nodes (EINs) with blockchain for efficient data processing. We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.",

  "title": "DCIV: Decentralized cross-chain data integrity verification with blockchain",
  "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain holds promise to impact a wide range of application areas, but it still suffers from technical challenges such as security and scalability. The increase in the number of transactions puts blockchains under data storage pressure. The emergence of cross-chain technologies connects different blockchains and relieves the data storage pressure. However, the existing research generally focuses on the technical realization of cross chain, lacking in-depth research on consistency issues like data integrity verification of cross-chain interaction. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cross-chain data integrity verification scheme (DCIV) from the point of view of governing the chain by chain. We adopt supervision chain to audit the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction. We preprocess the off-chain original data in the form of Merkle tree. Before cross-chain interaction, we process the data with KZG polynomial commitment. During the auditing period, the supervision chain generates a challenge and verifies the integrity of cross-chain data. In particular, we add audit digests into the structure of transactions in blockchain to reduce the storage burden during auditing. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that DCIV can verify the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction, achieving secure and accurate cross-chain data sharing.",

  "abstract": "The blockchain is tremendous technology for securing data transmission over a decentralized cloud environment. A PHR can offer easy data exchange and storage. However, unauthorised individuals may steal sensitive users' data from cloud devices, leading to significant privacy leakage risks. The main problem is that the non-authentication policy leads to key leakages due to unauthorised entries through intruders. To resolve this problem, we propose Blockchain-Based Decentralized Security (BCDS) using Crypto-Proof of Stake (CPoS) for securing sensitive Personal health care records. First, to process the security, the lattice construction phase is used based on blockchain decentralized. The Random shuffle block padding is intended to rehash the block to score with padding bits to block-level encryption. Then the sensitive terms are marginalized by threshold labels being highly encrypted by Optimized Starvation Point Link Encryption (OSPLE) to protect the data. By integrating Master Node Key Aggregation Policy (MNKAP) to verify the contact proof of staking authentication to the peer end to authenticate the security. The Delegate proof of stack provides higher security to protect the sensitive terms by accessing PHR records transactions to improve the integrity proofing to the admittance of the key to deliver the data. The key signature verification then validates the key for authentication to decrypt the protected data. This proves a higher security protocol and authentication principle than any other method as well as security proofing.",

In this paper, we propose a bidding application for the wholesale power market called Federated Learning Power Quotation System (FedLPQS), which combines federated learning and blockchain to consider the characteristics of the future power trading market of ”Liberalizing both ends”. FedLPQS using federated learning aggregates cost data of each power plant to achieve a certain degree of transparency and records the data in a blockchain platform based on the consortium chain to reduce the price of power traded in the wholesale power market.",

  "title": "Behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation in agrifood supply chain management: A thematic analysis",
  "abstract": "Despite its perceived utility, several companies and managers continue to hold reservations about blockchain implementation in supply chain management. To elucidate the causes, we examine the behavioural and organisational antecedents that influence the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management. To do this, we undertake thematic analysis on blockchain-related agri-food business news and expert opinions from the Ovid database's Agricola section. Four themes are central to our model: organisational adoption strategies, technical advantages, environmental obstacles, and implementation intention. Using these themes, we build a thematic map and derive three propositions about the role of behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation intention in supply chains, thus substantiating Behavioural Reasoning Theory (BRT) and Technology Organisation and Environment (TOE) theory's core arguments. Our findings elucidate novel factors influencing blockchain adoption in supply chains. More specifically, we show that managers who consider the technological benefits associated with blockchain capacity are able to provide stakeholders with new opportunities and embrace adoption strategies such as product launch and partnership formation while also considering environmental and contextual barriers such as market fragmentation, scarcity of research, and regulatory restrictions.",

  "abstract": "Could we rely on credit swap hedging as a substitute for insurer blockchain technology involvement? This paper is to develop a two-stage contingent claim model to answer the question. We have three main results. First, blockchain helps the policyholder protection when blockchain involvement is relatively large-scale, helps the insurer's survival probability when blockchain involvement is relatively small-scale and helps enable greater efficiency. Second, credit swap hedging adversely affects policyholder protection and increases a higher likelihood of insurer survival. The life insurance company could regard credit swap hedging as a strategic substitute for blockchain involvement. Third, capital regulation makes the insurer more prone to blockchain involvement, thereby accelerating the transformation of the insurance system.",

  "title": "Design of secured blockchain based decentralized authentication protocol for sensor networks with auditing and accountability",
  "abstract": "The traditional system designed by incorporating the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) suffers from important issues such as centralization of information, single source of trust, and fails to provide a trusted data-auditing solution due to the involvement of Third Party Auditor (TPA). This article proposes a novel solution by leveraging the concept of blockchain and Distributed Data Storage Service (DDSS) system to mitigate the issues mentioned above. In our model, the sensor nodes are accountable for their activity because the blockchain permanently records the logs of sensor nodes. The proposed solution provides the decentralized authentication of sensor nodes and the information stored in the fully distributed system. Furthermore, a decentralized data-auditing scheme without involving the TPA is also suggested, which finally benefits the user in terms of bandwidth and money. The formal verification of the proposed protocol is done using the Scyther simulator tool, which indicates that the protocol is safe and can protect against the relevant attacks with 100% accuracy. We have estimated the proposed scheme’s time complexity and computational efficiencies and compared them with the existing one. The computation and communication overhead of the proposed method is reduced by 22.143% and 12.5% compared with the Khalid et al. (2020) scheme. Lastly, the ethereum platform simulates our solution, confirming that less than USD 2 is required to execute the proposed solution.",

Blockchain technology is an emerging security technology that was explored by researchers in the past few years. Blockchain technology has been designed to protect information integrity and accountability. In a distributed manner making forgery and destruction of data can be very difficult. In this survey paper, we are specifically focused on how blockchain platforms adopt to the healthcare industry and achieve data integrity and accountability. Also, we will discuss the benefits and challenges of blockchain technology, and future blockchain research directions.

This paper analyzes the influence of the initial willingness of game players, the cost and utilization degree of blockchain technology, government subsidies, the price reduction coefficient of users, and the loss of photovoltaic-storage being wholesaled on the results of evolutionary equilibrium. The results show the cooperation between photovoltaic power generators and energy storage providers will become one of the trends of photovoltaic development in the future, and users will greatly enhance the utilization degree of photovoltaic and realize the value co-creation of the three parties. The decrease of blockchain technology cost, the increase of blockchain utilization, the increase of government subsidies, the increase of user price reduction coefficient, the decrease of photovoltaic-storage loss coefficient of being wholesaled and so on encourage the increase of cooperation of photovoltaic power generators and energy storage providers, and users' behavior of using photovoltaic.

  "abstract": "Recent improvements in consumers' awareness of product traceability have revealed the disadvantages of traditional supply chain traceability systems. Traditional traceability systems are centralized, and the data that they use are vulnerable to tampering, resulting in a low level of consumer trust. Blockchain technology, as a distributed ledger, can solve these problems. In this study, we examine the blockchain technology introduction decisions of a supply chain involving two competing manufacturers and a single retailer, and their effects on supply chain performance. We find that manufacturers should adopt blockchain technology only when consumer sensitivity to blockchain technology exceeds a certain level and manufacturers who can introduce blockchain technology first are more likely to reap big gains in profits. Regarding the unit verification fee that the retailer pays to the manufacturer when introducing blockchain technology, the manufacturer subsidizes this fee to the retailer in the form of lower wholesale prices. In other words, there is no additional wholesale cost to the retailer for blockchain technology-based products. The results of this study provide guidance for supply chain members’ market practices.",

Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a “double chain” structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.",

  "title": "HBFL: A hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework for collaborative IoT intrusion detection",
  "abstract": "The continuous strengthening of the security posture of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems is vital due to the increasing number of interconnected devices and the volume of sensitive data shared. Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model’s detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.",

  "title": "RZee: Cryptographic and statistical model for adversary detection and filtration to preserve blockchain privacy",
  "abstract": "Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization’s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.",

  "title": "Smart contract based digital evidence management framework over blockchain for vehicle accident investigation in IoV era",
  "abstract": "Digital collection and maintenance of evidence corresponding to an accident is of utmost relevance as vehicles become connected and part of Internet of things ecosystem. A conceptual evidence management framework is proposed examining the future of accident investigation forensics in the era of connected vehicles. The framework discusses how evidence generated from vehicles involved in incident along with supporting evidence from nearby vehicles CCTVs and road users can be collected and managed over blockchain using smart contracts in a vehicle to everything connected environment. The management of evidence over blockchain serves as an immutable and auditable means to investigate and settle cases post an accident among the stakeholders. Dynamic access control over evidence data and reports based on location of incident and vehicle involved is implemented with the help of smart contracts. The cost of deploying and carrying out transactions using the smart contracts is evaluated over both public and private Ethereum blockchain. Mechanism and cost involved in storing evidence on chain versus off chain using Inter Planetary File System in most optimised manner saving memory and execution cost is compared and presented. The smart contract codes are deployed on Rinkeby test network and can be accessed using address mentioned.",
